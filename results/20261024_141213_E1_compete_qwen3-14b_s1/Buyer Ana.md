# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. I'm Buyer Ana, and I need to maximize profitability for Delta Engineering over 20 hours. The market just opened in Hour #1 with specific bids and asks.\n\nFirst, the bid queue has three entries: Omar at 81.48, Ana (me) at 81.62, and Raj at 82.01. The ask queue has Zoe at 98.05, Jun at 97.29, and Tara at 96.25. My true value per lot is $100.00, so I need to buy at a price below that to make a profit. But I also need to secure a trade, which means my bid should be high enough to match an ask price.\n\nLooking at the asks, the lowest ask is 96.25 from Tara. If I bid higher than that, say 96.25 or more, there might be a trade. But my current bid is 81.62, which is way below the asks. That means there's no overlap between the bid and ask queues. So no trades are happening right now.\n\nWait, the problem says I can place a bid each hour. Since I'm in Hour #1, I can adjust my bid. My previous bid was 81.62, but maybe I should increase it to meet the asks. However, if I bid too high, I might pay more than the true value. But if I don't bid high enough, I might not get a trade. \n\nThe true value is $100, so I can afford to pay up to $100 per lot. But I need to make sure that my bid is high enough to meet the asks. The lowest ask is 96.25. So if I bid 96.25 or higher, there's a chance to trade. However, if I bid 96.25, there's a possibility that another buyer's bid is already there. Let me check the bid queue again. The highest bid is Raj at 82.01, which is still way below 96.25. So there's a big gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask. That means no trades have occurred yet.\n\nTherefore, my strategy should be to increase my bid to a level that can meet the lowest ask. Let's say I place a bid of 96.25. But wait, the lowest ask is 96.25, so if I bid that, there's a chance to trade. However, since the asks are from other sellers, my bid would match the ask if I bid equal or higher. But since the ask is 96.25, if I bid 96.25, the trade would be at that price. Then my profit would be 100 - 96.25 = $3.75 per lot. That's good. But I need to check if there's an existing bid that could match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better approach. Since the asks are at 96.25, 97.29, and 98.05, the next best is 96.25. If I bid 96.25, I can potentially match that. But the problem is that other buyers may also be trying to match these asks. However, in the current bid queue, there are no bids above the asks. So if I raise my bid to 96.25, that would be the highest bid, and if there's an ask at that price, a trade would occur.\n\nBut wait, the current bid queue includes my existing bid at 81.62. Since I can only place one bid per hour, I need to replace that. So in this hour, I should replace my bid with a higher value. Let's say 96.25. But I need to make sure that I don't exceed my true value. Since 96.25 is below 100, that's acceptable. However, maybe the market will move, so I shouldn't lock in at 96.25 if there's a chance to get a lower price. But given the current asks, that's the lowest possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe if I bid 96.25, there's a chance that someone else's bid could be higher. Wait, no, the current bids are all lower than the asks. So by raising my bid to 96.25, I can potentially capture the lowest ask. That would be a good strategy for this hour. So my bid should be 96.25. However, I need to check if that's allowed. The rules say I can place a bid per hour, and it must be in whole cents, which 96.25 is. \n\nSo the plan is to increase my bid to 96.25 to match the lowest ask. This way, I can secure a trade at that price, maximizing profit. The reflection part would note that in the first hour, there was no overlap between bids and asks, and I need to adjust my bid to meet the asks. The new memory would mention that I placed a bid of 96.25 in this hour. The scratch pad would include observations about the initial gap, thoughts on the need to bridge the gap, and the strategy to increase the bid."

  "reflection": "In Hour #1, my bid at $96.25 successfully secured a trade at $89.13, which was below my true value of $100. However, the discrepancy between the asks listed ($82.01) and the trade price ($89.13) suggests potential confusion in market data interpretation. This highlights the need to focus on current market data rather than historical bids/asks.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given the current empty bid and ask queues, I will reassert my bid at $96.25 to maintain competitiveness. This price aligns with my previous successful trade while ensuring profitability. If no asks are present, this bid will remain in the queue, potentially attracting future sellers.",

  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: The current bid and ask queues are empty, suggesting no active orders. The previous trade price ($89.13) is significantly lower than the listed asks ($82.01), indicating possible data inconsistencies or market dynamics not fully captured by historical records. #### Thoughts: Without active asks, my bid of $96.25 may not trigger a trade immediately but ensures I am positioned to capture future asks. The true value of $100 remains a hard limit to avoid overpayment. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain a bid of $96.25 to balance profitability and market participation. If no trades occur, reassess in subsequent hours based on updated market data.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start by looking at the previous hour's data. In Hour #1, I set my bid to 96.25, which matched the lowest ask price. That allowed me to make a trade with Seller Tara at $89.13, which was profitable since my true value is $100. However, the other sellers had asks at $82.01, which is way below my bid. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the asks were at $82.01, why did the trades happen at $89.13? Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Oh, right, the asks in the last 5 hours show that sellers had placed asks at $82.01, but the trades occurred at higher prices. That suggests that maybe the actual asks during Hour 1 were higher, or there's a discrepancy in the data.\n\nWait, the \"Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours\" for Hour 1 show that the sellers had asks at $82.01, but the trades happened at $89.13. That seems conflicting. Unless the asks were not the current ones but previous ones. Maybe the market rules allow for multiple asks and bids, and the trades happen when a bid matches an ask. So if I bid 96.25, which was the lowest ask at that time, then the trade occurred at that price. But the actual trade price was $89.13, which is lower than my bid. That's confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the data, or perhaps the trades were executed at the ask price, not the bid. Wait, in a double auction, when a bid matches an ask, the trade happens at the price of the ask. So if I bid 96.25 and there was an ask at 96.25, the trade would be at 96.25. But the trade here was at $89.13, which is lower. That suggests that maybe the asks were lower than my bid. But according to the data, the sellers had asks at $82.01. That's way lower. So why did the trade happen at $89.13? I must be missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours\" are the asks from previous hours, not the current ones. So in Hour 1, the current asks might have been higher, but the previous asks were at $82.01. Or maybe the data is showing that in the last 5 hours (which would be up to Hour 1), those asks were placed. But during Hour 1, the current asks might have been different. This is a bit unclear. However, the key point is that in Hour 1, I successfully made a trade at $89.13, which is below my true value of $100, so that was profitable.\n\nNow, for Hour 2, the current status shows empty bid and ask queues. The asks and bids placed in the last 5 hours are the same as before. So, the market might be in a state where there are no current asks or bids. Therefore, I need to place a bid that would either match existing asks or create a new bid that could lead to a trade.\n\nSince my true value is $100, I need to ensure that any bid I place doesn't exceed that. However, to secure a trade, I need to place a bid that is at least as high as the lowest ask. But if the current asks are empty, maybe there are no current asks, so I need to place a bid that might be matched with future asks.\n\nAlternatively, if there are no current asks, my bid might not get filled, but I need to maintain a presence in the market to have a chance to trade in subsequent hours. However, since the goal is to maximize profitability by Hour 20, I need to balance between making trades now and ensuring I don't overpay.\n\nIn the previous hour, the trade was at $89.13, which is a good profit. If I can maintain a bid that allows for similar trades, that's good. But since the current asks are empty, maybe the market is clearing, and I need to set a bid that's competitive. Perhaps setting the bid at $96.25 again, as before, but since the current asks are empty, maybe there are no immediate matches. However, if other sellers have placed asks in previous hours, but they might have been filled already. Alternatively, the market might be in a state where I need to be the first to place a bid again to create a potential match.\n\nAlternatively, since the current asks and bids are empty, maybe there are no current orders, so I need to place a bid that's attractive enough to encourage sellers to place asks that match it. But since I can only place one bid per hour, I have to choose a price that's optimal. Given that my true value is $100, I can't go above that. If I set my bid at $100, that's the maximum I can pay, but it might not be enough if the asks are higher. However, if there's no current ask, then my bid might not be filled, but it's better to have a bid on the table. Alternatively, setting a bid at $96.25 again, which was successful before, might be a safe choice to see if any asks come in that match.\n\nBut in the last hour, the trade was made at $89.13, which is much lower than my bid. That suggests that the actual ask price at that time was $89.13, but the data shows that the sellers had placed asks at $82.01. That inconsistency is confusing. Maybe the $82.01 is the original ask, but the trade happened at a higher price because of the bid. Wait, in a double auction, the trade happens at the ask price if the bid matches an ask. So if I bid $96.25 and the seller has an ask at $96.25, the trade is at $96.25. But in this case, the trade was at $89.13, which is lower. That suggests that the seller's ask was $89.13, but the data shows that the sellers had asks at $82.01. This is conflicting. Perhaps the data is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding in the data's interpretation.\n\nRegardless, moving forward, since the current asks and bids are empty, I need to place a bid. The best approach is to set a bid at a price that is profitable but still allows for a trade. If I set my bid at $96.25 again, which was the lowest ask in the previous hour, and assuming that there are no current asks, but perhaps in the next hour, other sellers might place asks that match my bid. Alternatively, if I set a higher bid, say $98, that might not be as profitable if the trade happens, but it could potentially lead to a better price if the market moves up. However, since the goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20, I need to balance between securing trades now and ensuring that any trades I make are at a price that doesn't eat into my profit margin too much.\n\nGiven that the previous trade was at $89.13, which is a good profit, I might want to try to secure similar or better prices. If I can set a bid that is slightly higher than the previous trade price, but still below $100, that could be beneficial. However, without knowing the current asks, it's risky to set a higher bid. Therefore, the safest bet is to maintain the previous bid of $96.25, which was successful in the first hour, and see if that leads to another trade. Alternatively, if I think that the market might have more sellers with lower asks, I could lower my bid slightly, but that might reduce the chance of a trade. \n\nIn the absence of current asks, the best strategy is to place a bid that is as high as possible without exceeding the true value. So $96.25 is still a reasonable choice. Therefore, I'll place a bid of $96.25 again in Hour 2, hoping that any existing asks or future asks will match it. If no trades happen, my bid remains in the queue, and I can adjust in subsequent hours as needed."

The previous bids were $96.25, which was higher than the asks, but maybe the sellers have adjusted their prices.\n\nWait, in the last 5 hours, the asks from Hour 1 were around $82.01, and in Hour 2, some sellers increased their asks to $89.13 and $81.00. But the trades happened at lower prices, like $89.13 and $88.62. That seems inconsistent because the asks were lower. Maybe there's a data entry error, but assuming the data is correct, the market might be volatile.\n\nIn the previous strategy, I kept the bid at $96.25. But since the queues are empty now, maybe there's no immediate trade. But I need to ensure that if any seller comes in with an ask that's lower than my bid, I can capture it. However, the true value is $100, so I shouldn't pay more than that. Since the last trade was at $92.69, which is below $100, maybe I can keep the bid at $96.25 to be in the range where I can profit if a seller comes in with an ask between $92.69 and $100.\n\nBut wait, if the current asks are not present, maybe the sellers are holding back. I should maintain the bid at $96.25 to be ready for any incoming asks. If there's no trade, I might need to adjust in the next hours. Also, checking the previous hours, other buyers like Omar and Raj had similar bids. So keeping a consistent bid could help in matching when a seller comes in.\n\nSo, the reflection should mention that the previous strategy was effective in securing trades, but the empty queues suggest no immediate activity. The plan is to maintain the bid at $96.25, as it's below the true value and allows for potential profit if a seller comes in. The new memory would note that no trades occurred this hour, and the bid was kept at $96.25. The scratch pad should update the observations and strategy accordingly."

# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I increased my bid to 96.25 to align with the lowest ask price, creating a potential for a trade.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I re-submitted a bid of $96.25. The market queues remain empty, indicating no immediate trades. My strategy remains focused on securing future matches at a price below my true value of $100.
Hour 3: Hour #3: No trades occurred; bid of $96.25 remained in the queue as market queues were empty.

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Jun at $92.69
Hour 3: You bought from Seller Jun at $94.38





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid and ask queues are empty, indicating no active orders. Recent trades suggest sellers may have adjusted ask prices upward, but historical data shows inconsistencies. #### Thoughts: The $96.25 bid balances profitability with caution, ensuring readiness for any asks that enter the market. Overpaying risks reduced margins, while underbidding could lose opportunities. #### Updated Strategy: Continue the $96.25 bid. If no trades occur in subsequent hours, reassess based on updated market data, prioritizing asks between $92.69 and $100.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what bid to place for Hour #4. Let me look at the information given.\n\nFirst, the current status of the bid and ask queues are empty. That means there are no active orders right now. The past trades show that Ana has been buying at increasing prices: $89.13 in Hour 1, $92.69 in Hour 2, and $94.38 in Hour 3. So each time, the price she paid went up. The sellers are probably raising their ask prices as well. \n\nLooking at the asks from previous hours, in Hour 1, the lowest ask was $82.01, but Ana's bid was $96.25, which was higher than that. Then in Hour 2, the asks were $89.13, $82.01, and $81.0. Wait, but Ana's bid was still $96.25, which was higher than some of those. Then in Hour 3, the asks were $92.5, $89.13, $85.0. Her bid was $96.25 again, which was above the lowest asks. However, the trades in Hour 3 had her buying at $94.38, which is close to her bid. \n\nBut in the last three hours, the highest she paid was $94.38. Her true value is $100, so she can afford to pay up to that. The previous bids from other buyers like Omar and Raj were sometimes lower than her bid, like $99.99 in Hour 3. But she's been sticking with $96.25. \n\nNow, since the queues are empty, maybe there's no immediate trade. But she needs to secure a trade before the end of Hour 20. If she keeps her bid at $96.25, maybe she'll get a trade when a seller posts an ask that's lower than her bid. However, looking at the trend, the asks have been increasing. In Hour 3, the lowest ask was $85.0, but the trade price was $94.38. That suggests that maybe the sellers are not just posting lower asks but the actual trades are happening at higher prices. Maybe there's some competition among buyers, so the sellers can ask higher prices.\n\nWait, but in the past trades, Ana's trades were at $89.13, $92.69, $94.38. So each time, the price increased. If the trend continues, maybe the next trade could be higher. But her true value is $100. She needs to make sure she doesn't pay more than that. But if she keeps her bid at $96.25, which is below $100, she's still within her margin. However, maybe the sellers are starting to ask prices closer to $96.25. If she keeps her bid at $96.25, she might get a trade at that price if a seller's ask is lower. But if the sellers are raising their asks, maybe she needs to increase her bid to stay competitive. \n\nBut the problem is that if she increases her bid, she might end up paying more. However, if she doesn't, she might miss out on trades. The previous strategy was to keep the bid at $96.25. But given that the last trade was at $94.38, which is below her bid, maybe the sellers are still posting asks lower than her bid. However, in the last three hours, the bid queues had her at $96.25, and the asks had some lower prices. But maybe the market is moving upwards. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she should increase her bid slightly to $96.50 or $96.75 to ensure that she's still competitive. But she needs to balance between getting a trade and not overpaying. Her true value is $100, so there's still room. If she bids higher, she might get a trade at a lower price (if the seller's ask is lower than her bid). However, if she bids too high, she might end up paying more than necessary. \n\nLooking at the previous successful trades, the prices have been increasing each hour. If that trend continues, maybe the next trade will be higher. But she can't be sure. The key is to maximize profit while securing a trade. Since the queues are empty now, maybe the sellers aren't active. But she needs to stay in the bid queue to be ready when a seller posts an ask. \n\nGiven that, maybe keeping the bid at $96.25 is still the best approach. It's below her true value and has been successful in previous hours. However, if the market trend is upwards, she might need to adjust. But without any current asks, she can't know. The reflection should note that the previous bids have been consistent, but the trend shows increasing prices. The plan for this hour is to maintain the bid at $96.25, as it's a balance between profitability and securing a trade. The new memory would state that she placed the same bid again, and the queues are empty. The scratchpad should update observations about the trend and confirm the strategy of maintaining the bid."

But in Hour 4, there were trades, so maybe the bid should stay at $96.25. However, the last trade for Ana was at $95.62, which is close to her current bid.

But if the asks are moving up, maybe she needs to increase her bid to capture those. However, increasing too much might reduce her profit margin.\n\nAlternatively, since the last trade she made was at $95.62, which is very close to her current bid of $96.25, maybe she can keep that bid. If there's a seller with an ask between $95.62 and $96.25, she can get a trade. But since the queues are empty now, maybe there's no immediate match.\n\nBut the scratchpad's strategy says if no trades in the next 2-3 hours, incrementally raise. Since this is Hour 5, maybe she hasn't had a trade in the last few hours. Wait, in Hour 4, she had a trade. So maybe the plan is to keep $96.25. However, the other buyers like Omar are bidding higher, so Ana might need to match that to not miss out. But her true value is $100, so she can't go over that.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best move is to keep the bid at $96.25, as before, but also note that if there's no trade in the next few hours, she should increase it. Since the current strategy from the scratchpad is to continue $96.25 unless no trades, and since in Hour 4 there was a trade, maybe she should stick with that. But the last bid in Hour 4 was $96.25. The new Hour 5, the queues are empty, so perhaps she should maintain the same bid."

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out my bid for Hour #6 as Buyer Ana. Let me look back at the previous hours and the market status provided.\n\nFirst, my true value is $100 per lot. The past trades show that the prices I've paid have been increasing each hour. In Hour 1, I bought at $89.13, then $92.69, $94.38, $95.62, and $96.12. So the trend is clearly upwards. The other buyers, like Omar and Raj, have been bidding up to $99.99 and $96.27 in the last hour. The sellers' asks have also been rising: Jun went from $82.01 to $96.0, Tara from $82.01 to $96.0, and Zoe's asks have been fluctuating but also moving up.\n\nIn the last hour (Hour 5), there were no trades because the bid queues were empty, but the executed prices have been increasing. The previous strategy was to keep the bid at $96.25, but there's a thought that if no trades happen in Hours 6-7, we might need to increase the bid to counter possible higher asks. However, the current Hour 6 is now, so I need to decide on the bid now.\n\nThe Ask Queue and Bid Queue are both empty in the current status. That means there's no immediate match. The last trades in Hour 5 were at $96.13 and $96.12, which are very close to my true value. If I keep the bid at $96.25, maybe there's a chance that a seller might come in with an ask at or below that. But the trend suggests that asks are rising. If I don't increase my bid, I might miss out on trades as the asks go higher. However, increasing the bid too much risks buying at a price closer to the true value, reducing profit margins.\n\nLooking at the other buyers' bids, Omar has $99.99, which is just under $100. Raj has $96.27. If I bid $96.25, it's slightly lower than Raj's bid. But maybe the sellers are starting to price closer to the true value. Alternatively, if I raise my bid a bit, say $96.50, I might capture more of the available asks. However, the previous strategy was to incrementally increase the bid by $0.25-$0.50 if no trades happen in Hours 6-7. Since this is Hour 6, and there's a chance that the asks might be at $96.0 or higher, maybe increasing the bid slightly would be better to secure a trade without going over $100.\n\nWait, but the previous plan was to keep $96.25 unless no trades occur in 6-7. Since this is the first of those hours, maybe the plan is to stick with $96.25 for now and see if any trades come in. However, given that in Hour 5 there were no trades, and the last executed price was $96.12, which is very close to my current bid. If I raise the bid to $96.50, I might get a trade at a slightly higher price but still below $100. Alternatively, keeping $96.25 might not be competitive enough if the asks are moving up.\n\nBut the problem is that the bid queues are empty now. So, if I place a bid, it's possible that the asks might come in at a lower price. But since the previous hours had the asks increasing, maybe the sellers are now at $96.0. If I bid $96.25, there's a chance that a seller's ask is at $96.0, which would match. However, if the asks are now at $96.0, but I have a bid at $96.25, that would result in a trade at $96.0. Wait, no, in a double auction, the trade happens at the best bid and ask. If I have a bid at $96.25 and the ask is at $96.0, then the trade would occur at $96.0. But in the last hour, the asks were $96.0 from Jun and Tara, and Zoe at $89.0. So if I bid $96.25, that would match with the $96.0 asks, resulting in a trade at $96.0. That's a good deal, as it's still below my true value of $100. However, if the ask is at $96.0, the trade would happen at $96.0, which is a profit of $4 per lot.\n\nBut if I don't increase my bid, and the asks continue to rise, then in subsequent hours, the price might go higher. However, the current strategy was to keep $96.25 unless no trades occur in 6-7. Since this is Hour 6, maybe it's safer to keep the same bid, as the previous hour didn't have any trades. Alternatively, maybe I should increase the bid slightly to $96.50 to be more competitive. But the previous plan was to incrementally increase if no trades occur in 6-7. Since this is Hour 6, and assuming that in Hour 6 there are no trades, then in Hour 7, the bid should be increased. However, the problem is that the user is asking for the bid for Hour 6. So, the plan is to keep the bid at $96.25, and if in Hour 6 there are no trades, then in Hour 7, increase it by $0.25-$0.50.\n\nBut looking at the last hour's Ask Queue: in Hour 5, the asks were Jun $96.0, Tara $96.0, Zoe $89.0. So, if I bid $96.25, that should match with the $96.0 asks, resulting in a trade at $96.0. However, the Bid Queue is empty, so if I place a bid, it's possible that the asks are still at $96.0. But the problem is that the user's current status says the Bid Queue and Ask Queue are empty. So, maybe in Hour 5, there were no trades because the bids and asks didn't meet. But in Hour 5, there were past trades: Hour 5 had three trades where the buyer Ana bought from Seller Tara at $96.12. So, in Hour 5, there were trades. Wait, the current status for Hour 5 has the Ask Queue with Jun $96.0, Tara $96.0, Zoe $89.0. So, the bid from Ana was $96.25, which would match with the $96.0 asks. However, the user's past trades for Hour 5 show that Ana bought from Tara at $96.12. That suggests that the ask price was $96.12. Maybe the Ask Queue in Hour 5 had a seller with an ask at $96.12, which is slightly lower than $96.0? Wait, the user provided the Ask Queue for Hour 5 as Jun $96.0, Tara $96.0, Zoe $89.0. But the trade was at $96.12. That seems inconsistent. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking back at the Market Status for Hour 5:\n\n## Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours\n\nHour 5:\n  Seller Jun ask $96.0\n  Seller Tara ask $96.0\n  Seller Zoe ask $89.0\n  Buyer Ana bid $96.25\n  Buyer Omar bid $99.99\n  Buyer Raj bid $96.27\n\nAnd the Past Trades for Hour 5:\n\nHour 5: Buyer Omar bought from Seller Zoe at $94.5\nHour 5: Buyer Raj bought from Seller Jun at $96.13\nHour 5: Buyer Ana bought from Seller Tara at $96.12\n\nSo, the asks from Jun and Tara are $96.0, but Ana bought from Tara at $96.12. That suggests that the actual trade price was $96.12, which is higher than the ask price. That doesn't make sense in a double auction, because the trade should occur at the ask price if the bid is higher. Wait, maybe the Ask Queue is the list of asks, but the actual executed price depends on the matching. So, if there's a bid at $96.25 and the ask is $96.0, then the trade would occur at $96.0. But in this case, the trade was at $96.12, which is higher than $96.0. That suggests that there was an ask at $96.12. Maybe there's a discrepancy in the data. Alternatively, perhaps the Ask Queue in Hour 5 had multiple asks, including one at $96.12, which was the one that matched with Ana's bid.\n\nBut given the data provided, the Ask Queue for Hour 5 has Jun and Tara at $96.0, and Zoe at $89.0. The bid from Ana was $96.25. So, the bid should have matched with the $96.0 asks, resulting in a trade at $96.0. However, the actual trade was at $96.12, which is higher. That's confusing. Maybe the data is incorrect or there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the asks are not the current asks but the ones placed in that hour. So, maybe in Hour 5, the Seller Tara had an ask at $96.0, but the actual price was $96.12 because of some other factors. Alternatively, perhaps the data is correct, and the $96.12 is from a different seller. But according to the provided data, the asks in Hour 5 are only Jun $96.0, Tara $96.0, Zoe $89.0. So, the only possible asks that could have matched with Ana's $96.25 bid are $96.0. Therefore, the trade should have been at $96.0, but the recorded trade is at $96.12. That might be a mistake in the data, but I have to work with what's given.\n\nAssuming that the data is accurate, maybe the asks in Hour 5 had a $96.12 ask, but the data only shows $96.0. That could be a data inconsistency. However, since the user provided that in Hour 5, the Ask Queue for Jun and Tara is $96.0, and the trade was at $96.12, perhaps the actual ask was $96.12, and the data is missing that. Alternatively, maybe the data is correct, and there's a different explanation. But regardless, moving forward, I need to make a decision based on the given info.\n\nAssuming that the Ask Queue in the current Hour 6 is empty, but based on the previous trend, sellers are likely to increase their asks. The previous strategy was to keep the bid at $96.25 unless no trades occur in Hours 6-7. Since this is Hour 6, and there's no indication that the current hour has any trades, the plan is to maintain the bid at $96.25. However, considering that the last executed price was $96.12 (in Hour 5), the next possible ask might be $96.12 or higher. If I keep the bid at $96.25, there's a chance that the asks might be at $96.12, which would result in a trade at $96.12, which is still profitable. But if the asks are higher, say $96.50, then my bid of $96.25 would not match, and I might not get a trade.\n\nAlternatively, if I increase my bid to $96.50, I might get a trade at a higher price, but risk paying closer to the true value. However, the previous strategy was to incrementally increase the bid if no trades occur in 6-7. Since this is Hour 6, and there's no trade yet, the plan is to keep the same bid and see if it results in a trade in this hour. If not, in Hour 7, increase the bid.\n\nTherefore, the bid for Hour 6 should remain at $96.25. The reflection would note that the increasing trend of executed prices suggests that the asks are moving up, and maintaining the same bid may not be sufficient. However, without data on current asks, the plan is to stick with the previous bid and adjust if necessary in subsequent hours."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I increased my bid to 96.25 to align with the lowest ask price, creating a potential for a trade.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I re-submitted a bid of $96.25. The market queues remain empty, indicating no immediate trades. My strategy remains focused on securing future matches at a price below my true value of $100.
Hour 3: Hour #3: No trades occurred; bid of $96.25 remained in the queue as market queues were empty.
Hour 4: Hour #4: Bid of $96.25 submitted as queues remained empty. No new trades occurred, but historical trends suggest continued upward pressure on ask prices.
Hour 5: Hour #5: Bid of $96.25 submitted as queues remained empty. No trades occurred, but historical trends suggest continued upward pressure on ask prices.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $96.50 to align with the upward trend of ask prices and increase the likelihood of securing a trade. The bid queues remained empty, but the strategy adjustment reflects the need to stay competitive as the market approaches the true value.

If not, increase by $0.25 in Hour #8 to stay competitive with potential ask increases.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what bid to place for Hour #7. Let me look at the information provided.\n\nFirst, the current status of the bid queue has Buyer Raj with a bid of $96.29. The ask queue has Seller Tara at $97.00. So the current bid is lower than the ask, meaning no immediate trade. But I need to place my bid. My true value is $100, so I want to buy at as low as possible but still get a trade.\n\nLooking at the past trades, the last one I made was at $95.5 in Hour 6. The executed prices have been rising, like in Hour 5, I bought at $96.12. The last few hours show that the asks have been increasing. For example, in Hour 6, Seller Tara's ask went up to $97.00. \n\nThe previous strategy was to increase the bid to $96.50 in Hour 6 to stay competitive. But in Hour 6, I placed a bid of $96.50, and the bid queue had others like Buyer Raj at $96.29 and Buyer Omar at $99.99. However, the ask was at $97.00. So my bid of $96.50 is still below the ask, so no trade. \n\nNow, for Hour 7, I need to adjust. The asks have gone up to $97.00. If I keep my bid at $96.50, it's still below the ask, so no trade. But maybe I should increase my bid to be closer to the ask. Let's check the bid queue. The current highest bid is $96.29 from Raj. If I place a higher bid, say $96.50, but the ask is $97.00. Wait, but in the last hour, my bid was $96.50, which is still below the ask. So no trade. \n\nBut my previous plan was to increase by $0.25 each hour if no trades. However, in Hour 6, I increased to $96.50, but no trade. So maybe I need to increase more. Let's see the trend. The asks have been going up. In Hour 5, the asks were $96.0 and $96.0. In Hour 6, Seller Tara's ask jumped to $97.00. So the sellers are pushing higher. If I don't match their asks, I might not get a trade. \n\nMy true value is $100, so I can afford to pay up to that. But I want to maximize profit. If I can get a trade at $97.00, my profit is $3.00 per lot. If I bid higher, maybe I can get a trade. But if I bid $97.00, that's equal to the ask, so it would match. However, the existing bid queue has Raj at $96.29. If I bid $97.00, that would be higher than the current bid, so my bid would be at the top. But the ask is $97.00, so if I bid $97.00, that would meet the ask, and a trade would happen. \n\nWait, but the current ask is $97.00 from Seller Tara. If my bid is $97.00, then that would be a match. So I should consider placing a bid at $97.00. That way, if seller Tara is still there, I can get the trade. But is that allowed? The rules say that bids can't be sub-cent, so $97.00 is okay. \n\nBut let me check the previous bids. In Hour 6, I bid $96.50, which is below the ask of $97.00. So no trade. So for Hour 7, to get a trade, my bid needs to be at least $97.00. \n\nBut my true value is $100, so I can afford up to that. If I bid $97.00, that's better than $96.50. However, maybe there's a risk that the ask could go up further. But given that the last trade was at $96.12, and the current ask is $97.00, it's possible that the next trade could be around $97.00. \n\nSo, the plan is to place a bid of $97.00. That would match the current ask. If that's the case, I can secure a trade. But if the ask is still $97.00, then that's the best possible price. Alternatively, if I bid $97.00, and the ask is still $97.00, then the trade happens. \n\nBut wait, the current bid queue has Buyer Raj at $96.29. If I place a bid of $97.00, it would be higher than Raj's bid, so my bid would be the highest in the queue. Then, the ask is $97.00, so the trade would occur. \n\nSo, the bid should be $97.00. That would secure a trade if the ask remains at $97.00. \n\nBut I need to check if that's within my strategy. The previous strategy was to increase by $0.25 each hour. From $96.25 to $96.50 in Hour 6. Then, for Hour 7, increasing by another $0.25 would be $96.75. But considering that the ask is now $97.00, maybe increasing to $97.00 is more strategic. However, the previous plan was to adjust based on trends. Since the asks are moving up, perhaps increasing the bid to match the ask is better. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid $96.75, that's still below the ask of $97.00, so no trade. But if I bid $97.00, I can get a trade. So, the optimal bid here is $97.00. \n\nTherefore, the plan for Hour 7 is to place a bid of $97.00. That should match the current ask and secure a trade at that price. This way, I can make a profit of $3.00 per lot, which is better than the previous trades. \n\nNow, reflecting on previous outcomes: the strategy of incrementing by $0.25 each hour worked up to a point, but the asks increased more rapidly. Therefore, the improvement is to adjust the bid to match the current ask when possible, rather than just incrementing by a fixed amount. \n\nIn the scratch pad, the observations would note the rising asks and the need to adjust bids to meet them. The updated strategy would be to increase the bid to $97.00 in Hour 7 to match the current ask."

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The ask prices have surged to $97.00, reflecting increased seller confidence. My bid of $97.00 aligns with this ask, creating a direct match potential. #### Thoughts: By matching the ask, I ensure a trade occurs at the current market price, leveraging the upward trend without overpaying. If no trade occurs, I may need to reassess if the ask has moved further. #### Updated Strategy: Bid at $97.00 for Hour #7. If a trade is executed, maintain the bid at $97.00. If not, increase by $0.25 in Hour #8 to stay competitive with potential ask increases.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to understand the current market status and what's happened so far. The user is Buyer Ana from Delta Engineering, trying to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20. The true value per lot is $100, so she wants to buy at a price below that but still secure trades.\n\nLooking at the past hours, the bids and asks have been moving up. In Hour 7, Ana's bid was $97.00, matching the ask prices from Sellers Jun, Tara, and Zoe. But there's no info on whether that bid resulted in a trade. The past trades show that Ana has been buying at increasing prices, from $89.13 up to $96.65 in Hour 7. The asks have been rising too, with Seller Tara and Jun now at $97.00.\n\nThe current status for Hour 8 shows empty bid and ask queues, but looking at the last 5 hours, the asks were at $96.29 in Hour 7. However, in Hour 7, Ana bid $97.00, which might have matched the asks. But since the current queues are empty, maybe the bid didn't get matched. Or perhaps the asks have moved up again.\n\nThe previous strategy was to bid at $97.00 for Hour 7, and if no trade, increase by $0.25 in Hour 8. But in Hour 7, the asks were $96.29, so Ana's $97.00 would be higher than that. Wait, but in the last 5 hours, the asks in Hour 7 were $96.29. So Ana's bid of $97.00 would be above the asks, which should result in a trade. But if the bid queue is empty now, maybe the trade already happened, and the bid was removed. However, the user's successful trades include Hour 7: bought from Seller Zoe at $96.65. That's under $97.00. So maybe the bid of $97.00 didn't match because the asks were at $96.29, but the actual trade price was $96.65. That suggests that maybe the asks were at $96.65, and Ana's bid was $97.00, which would match. Hmm, need to check the data again.\n\nLooking at the Asks/Bids in the last 5 hours for Hour 7: Seller Jun, Tara, Zoe all asked $96.29. Buyers Ana, Omar, Raj all bid $97.00. So if Ana's bid was $97.00, and the ask is $96.29, that should be a match. But the successful trade for Hour 7 was at $96.65. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Maybe the asks in Hour 7 were actually higher? Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the Asks/Bids for Hour 7: Seller Jun, Tara, Zoe all asked $96.29. Buyers Ana, Omar, Raj bid $97.00. But the past trade for Hour 7 shows Ana bought from Zoe at $96.65. That's inconsistent. Maybe there's a typo in the data? Or maybe the asks in Hour 7 were $96.65? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the Asks/Bids for Hour 7: Seller Jun ask $96.29, Tara $96.29, Zoe $96.29. Buyers Ana, Omar, Raj bid $97.00. So if Ana's bid is $97.00, which is higher than the asks, there should be a trade at the ask price of $96.29. But the past trade shows Ana bought at $96.65. That suggests that maybe the actual ask in Hour 7 was $96.65, not $96.29. There might be an error in the data provided. Alternatively, maybe the asks in Hour 7 were $96.65, which would match Ana's bid of $97.00. But according to the data, the asks were $96.29. This inconsistency is confusing, but I'll proceed with the given data.\n\nAssuming that in Hour 7, Ana bid $97.00, and the asks were $96.29, then there should have been a trade. However, the successful trades for Hour 7 show Ana bought at $96.65. That suggests that the data might have a mistake, but I have to work with what's given. Maybe the asks in Hour 7 were actually $96.65, and the data entry was wrong. Alternatively, maybe the bid was $96.65. But according to the data, Ana's bid in Hour 7 was $97.00.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the data is correct, and the trade price of $96.65 is a result of a different match. Maybe other buyers had lower bids that matched the asks. For example, if another buyer had a bid of $96.65, which matches the ask of $96.65. But in the Asks/Bids for Hour 7, the sellers are at $96.29, so that's conflicting.\n\nThis is a bit confusing, but proceeding with the given data. The user's reflection needs to consider the previous outcomes and improvements. The plan for Hour 8 would be to adjust the bid based on the previous strategy. The previous strategy was to increase by $0.25 if no trade in Hour 7. But if a trade did occur, then maybe the bid should stay at $97.00. But without knowing if a trade happened in Hour 7, the user might have to proceed with the plan.\n\nGiven that the current status for Hour 8 shows empty queues, it's possible that the previous bid wasn't matched. So the plan would be to increase the bid by $0.25, making it $97.25. However, the true value is $100, so Ana needs to ensure she doesn't overpay. The reflection should note that the previous bid of $97.00 didn't result in a trade, so increasing the bid to stay competitive. The new memory would note the bid for Hour 8. The scratch pad update would adjust the strategy accordingly."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I increased my bid to 96.25 to align with the lowest ask price, creating a potential for a trade.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I re-submitted a bid of $96.25. The market queues remain empty, indicating no immediate trades. My strategy remains focused on securing future matches at a price below my true value of $100.
Hour 3: Hour #3: No trades occurred; bid of $96.25 remained in the queue as market queues were empty.
Hour 4: Hour #4: Bid of $96.25 submitted as queues remained empty. No new trades occurred, but historical trends suggest continued upward pressure on ask prices.
Hour 5: Hour #5: Bid of $96.25 submitted as queues remained empty. No trades occurred, but historical trends suggest continued upward pressure on ask prices.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $96.50 to align with the upward trend of ask prices and increase the likelihood of securing a trade. The bid queues remained empty, but the strategy adjustment reflects the need to stay competitive as the market approaches the true value.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I submitted a bid of $97.00 to match the current ask price of $97.00 from Seller Tara, aiming to secure a trade. The bid queue now includes my $97.00 offer, which is competitive with the current ask.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I submitted a bid of $97.25 to align with the observed upward trend in ask prices and increase the likelihood of securing a trade.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's break this down. I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #9. Let me check the previous data.\n\nLooking at the current status: the Bid Queue has Buyer Raj at 96.66, and the Ask Queue has Seller Tara at 97.0. The last bid from Hour 8 was 97.25, but no trade happened. So maybe the asks have gone up again. \n\nIn the past trades, the prices have been increasing. For example, in Hour 8, Ana bought at 97.12. The last trade was at 97.12, but the current ask is 97.0. Wait, that's interesting. The ask is 97.0, but the last trade was at 97.12. That might mean there's a discrepancy or maybe the ask is lower now. But in the last 5 hours, the asks have been moving upwards. \n\nIn the last 5 hours, the asks from Jun, Tara, and Zoe have been increasing. For example, in Hour 6, Tara's ask was 97.0, which is the current ask. But in Hour 8, the asks from Jun and Tara are 97.0. So maybe the market is stabilizing at 97.0. However, the bid from Hour 8 was 97.25, which is higher than the current ask. If there's a bid higher than the ask, a trade should happen. But since there's no trade, maybe the ask has increased beyond 97.25. Wait, the current ask is 97.0. So why no trade? Maybe there are no matching asks at 97.0. Let me check the Ask Queue again. It's [(97.0, 'Seller Tara')]. So if Ana bids 97.25, that would be higher than the ask, so a trade should occur. But it didn't. Hmm, maybe the bid was placed but not matched yet. Or perhaps the system only matches when the bid is exactly at the ask price. Wait, in a double auction, the highest bid matches the lowest ask. If Ana's bid is 97.25, and the ask is 97.0, then the bid is higher than the ask. So the trade should happen at 97.0. But maybe the system only matches when the bid is at the ask price. Wait, the rules say you place a bid, and if it's higher than the ask, then a trade occurs. Wait, no. In a typical auction, a bid is a price you're willing to pay, and an ask is the price someone is selling. If your bid is higher than the ask, then the trade happens at the ask price. But in this case, the bid is 97.25, and the ask is 97.0. So the trade should happen at 97.0. However, in Hour 8, Ana bid 97.25, but there's no trade mentioned for that hour. The successful trades for Hour 8 show Ana bought from Jun at 97.12. So maybe that trade was at 97.12, which is higher than the current ask. That's confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the bids and asks are in queues, and the system processes them in order. If Ana's bid is higher than the ask, the trade should happen. But since there's no trade, maybe the ask has increased beyond 97.25. Wait, but the current ask is 97.0. Maybe the bid was placed but the system hasn't matched it yet. Or perhaps there's a delay. \n\nGiven that, for Hour 9, the strategy should be to increase the bid again. The previous bid was 97.25, which didn't result in a trade. So maybe the asks have gone up. The current ask is 97.0, but maybe the next hour's asks are higher. So to stay competitive, Ana should increase her bid by another 0.25 to 97.50. That would be in line with the upward trend. If she bids 97.50, and the ask is 97.0, then the trade would occur at 97.0, which is below her true value of 100. That's a good deal. \n\nBut looking at the past trades, the last successful trade for Ana was at 97.12. The current ask is 97.0. If Ana bids 97.0, she could get the trade. But her previous bid was 97.25, which was higher than the ask. So why didn't it match? Maybe the system only matches when the bid is exactly at the ask price. If that's the case, then Ana's bid needs to be exactly at the current ask price to secure a trade. However, in Hour 7, Ana bid 97.0 and that matched the ask, leading to a trade. Then in Hour 8, she increased to 97.25, but no trade. So that suggests that the ask might have increased. But the current ask is 97.0. Maybe the system is matching the highest bid that's equal to or higher than the ask. But in that case, the bid of 97.25 should have matched the 97.0 ask. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the system requires that the bid is equal to the ask. If that's the case, then Ana should bid exactly at the current ask. But the current ask is 97.0. However, in the past, when Ana bid 97.0 in Hour 7, she got a trade. Then in Hour 8, she bid higher (97.25), but the ask was still 97.0. Why didn't that result in a trade? Maybe the system allows for bids to be higher than the ask, but only the highest bid that meets or exceeds the ask is matched. But in that case, the trade should have occurred at the ask price. \n\nThis is a bit confusing, but given the previous strategy, increasing the bid by 0.25 each hour seems to be the approach. So for Hour 9, bid 97.50. That would be in line with the upward trend and increase the chance of securing a trade. Even if the current ask is 97.0, the bid of 97.50 would be higher, leading to a trade at 97.0. That's profitable for Ana."

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The previous bid of $97.25 did not result in a trade, suggesting that the ask prices may have risen or the bid was not competitive enough. #### Thoughts: Increasing the bid by an additional $0.25 ensures continued alignment with the market's upward trajectory while maintaining a profit margin below the true value of $100.00. This adjustment aims to secure a trade by staying ahead of potential ask price increases. #### Updated Strategy: Bid at $97.50 for Hour #9. If no trade occurs, increase by another $0.25 in Hour #10 to maintain competitiveness with potential ask price increases.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm Buyer Ana for Delta Engineering, and I need to figure out my bid for Hour #10. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20, so I need to balance high profit margins with securing trades.\n\nFirst, looking at the past trades, my successful bids have been increasing over time. From Hour 1's $89.13 up to Hour 9's $97.08. The true value is $100, so I want to bid below that but as high as possible to get trades. The previous bid in Hour 9 was $97.50, which didn't result in a trade. The Ask Queue was empty then, so maybe the sellers have raised their prices.\n\nLooking at the last 5 hours' asks and bids, in Hour 9, the asks were $96.66 from Jun, Tara, and Zoe. My bid was $97.50, which should have matched the asks, but there's no trade mentioned. Wait, in the Past Trades for Hour 9, I did get a trade from Seller Jun at $97.08. But maybe that was a different bid? Wait, the user's memory says in Hour 9, the bid was $97.50, but the trade was at $97.08. That's confusing. Maybe the bid wasn't matched because the asks were at $96.66, and my bid was higher, so it should have matched. But according to the Past Trades, I bought at $97.08. Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Or perhaps the asks in Hour 9 were actually higher than $96.66? Wait, the Market Status for Hour 9 shows Seller Jun, Tara, Zoe all asking $96.66. So my bid of $97.50 should have matched that. But the trade was at $97.08. That suggests maybe the bid wasn't processed correctly, or there was another factor. Maybe the asks were updated during the hour, or there was a delay. Alternatively, maybe the bid was placed after the ask was already filled. \n\nBut according to the user's memory, in Hour 9, they submitted a bid of $97.50, and the trade was at $97.08. So maybe the bid wasn't in the queue when the ask was available. Or perhaps the system processes bids and asks in a way that if there's a bid higher than the ask, it's matched immediately. But if the bid was placed at $97.50 and the asks were at $96.66, that should have matched. However, the trade price was $97.08, which is between $96.66 and $97.50. That's odd. Maybe there's an error in the data, but I have to work with what's given.\n\nNow, moving to Hour 10. The current Bid Queue and Ask Queue are both empty. So there's no immediate trades. The last asks in the past 5 hours show that in Hour 9, the asks were $96.66. But in Hour 8, the asks were $97.0 from Jun and Tara, and $96.29 from Zoe. Then in Hour 9, they dropped to $96.66. Wait, that seems inconsistent. But maybe sellers are adjusting their asks based on market movements.\n\nThe strategy scratchpad from the user mentions increasing the bid by $0.25 to $97.50 in Hour 9, expecting that if no trade occurs, they'd go to $97.75 in Hour 10. However, in Hour 9, the bid was $97.50, and a trade did happen at $97.08. So maybe the bid was successful but the price was lower than the bid. That's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the bid was placed after the ask was already filled. \n\nBut given that the Ask Queue is empty now, I need to adjust my bid. The previous bid was $97.50, but since there's no trade, I need to consider if the market is moving upwards. The true value is $100, so I have room to bid higher. If the asks have been rising, maybe I should increase my bid again. However, the user's scratchpad suggests increasing by another $0.25 to $97.75 in Hour 10. But I should check if that's the right move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the average of the past trades. My successful bids have been increasing each hour, so continuing that trend might be beneficial. However, I need to ensure I don't overpay. The last trade I made was at $97.08, so maybe I can bid slightly higher than that, say $97.25 to $98.00. But the user's previous strategy was to increase by $0.25 each time.\n\nWait, in the scratchpad, the user says: \"If no trade occurs, increase by another $0.25 in Hour #10 to maintain competitiveness with potential ask price increases.\" Since in Hour 9, the bid of $97.50 didn't result in a trade (but there was a trade at $97.08, which might have been due to an earlier bid), but the current status for Hour 10 shows empty queues. So the user's plan is to increase to $97.75.\n\nBut I need to make sure that increasing by $0.25 is the correct strategy. Since the true value is $100, and the market is moving upwards, but the asks might have increased beyond $97.50. If I bid $97.75, that would be closer to the true value, but still under. However, if the asks are now higher, this bid might not match. Alternatively, if the asks are stable or lower, this bid would secure a trade.\n\nGiven the previous trend of increasing bids, and the fact that the last trade was at $97.08, moving to $97.75 would be a logical step. However, I need to consider that the user's previous bid in Hour 9 was $97.50, which should have matched the $96.66 asks. But since the trade was at $97.08, maybe the asks had been raised during the hour. Therefore, in Hour 10, if I bid $97.75, it's possible that the asks have increased again, so the bid would be more competitive.\n\nTherefore, following the previous strategy, the bid for Hour 10 should be $97.75. Then, the reflection would note that the previous bid of $97.50 didn't result in a trade (though there was a trade at $97.08, which may have been due to an earlier bid), and the plan is to increase by $0.25 again. The new memory would state that in Hour 10, the bid was $97.75 with no trades, and the scratchpad would update the observations and strategy accordingly."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I increased my bid to 96.25 to align with the lowest ask price, creating a potential for a trade.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I re-submitted a bid of $96.25. The market queues remain empty, indicating no immediate trades. My strategy remains focused on securing future matches at a price below my true value of $100.
Hour 3: Hour #3: No trades occurred; bid of $96.25 remained in the queue as market queues were empty.
Hour 4: Hour #4: Bid of $96.25 submitted as queues remained empty. No new trades occurred, but historical trends suggest continued upward pressure on ask prices.
Hour 5: Hour #5: Bid of $96.25 submitted as queues remained empty. No trades occurred, but historical trends suggest continued upward pressure on ask prices.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $96.50 to align with the upward trend of ask prices and increase the likelihood of securing a trade. The bid queues remained empty, but the strategy adjustment reflects the need to stay competitive as the market approaches the true value.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I submitted a bid of $97.00 to match the current ask price of $97.00 from Seller Tara, aiming to secure a trade. The bid queue now includes my $97.00 offer, which is competitive with the current ask.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I submitted a bid of $97.25 to align with the observed upward trend in ask prices and increase the likelihood of securing a trade.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I submitted a bid of $97.50 to align with the upward trend in ask prices. No immediate trade occurred, but the bid is now in the queue to potentially match with the current ask price of $97.0.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I submitted a bid of $97.75. The bid and ask queues remained empty, suggesting no immediate trades occurred despite the increased bid.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm Buyer Ana for Delta Engineering in this continuous double auction. The goal is to maximize profitability by Hour 20. My true value per lot is $100, so I need to bid below that but still get trades.\n\nLooking at the market status for Hour 11, both bid and ask queues are empty. The last few hours show that my bids have been increasing incrementally. In Hour 10, I bid $97.75, and there was a trade at $97.2. But the queues were empty, which might mean that even though I bid higher, the asks might have been lower or there was a timing issue.\n\nFrom the past trades, my successful bids have been getting closer to $100 each hour. The last trade was at $97.2 in Hour 10. The previous strategy was to increase by $0.25 each hour. But maybe that's too aggressive? Or maybe not. If the asks are rising, I need to keep up. However, if I bid too high, I might not get a trade, but if I bid too low, I might be leaving money on the table.\n\nIn the last 5 hours, the asks have been around $96.66 to $97.0, and my bids were increasing to match. However, in Hour 10, the asks were $96.66, and my bid was $97.75. That's a significant gap. Maybe the asks are actually lower than my bid, so there's no match. But why didn't the system match that? Because the bid queue and ask queue were empty. So maybe sellers are not placing asks at that level anymore.\n\nWait, in the last 5 hours, the asks from the past data: Hour 6 had asks at $94.5, $97.0, $92.0. Then in Hour 7, they adjusted to $96.29. Then in Hour 8, $97.0, $96.29. Hour 9, $96.66. Hour 10, $96.66. So the asks have been fluctuating but generally increasing. My bids were increasing as well, but perhaps I need to adjust to the current ask prices.\n\nIn Hour 10, the current asks were $96.66, and I bid $97.75. That's a $1.09 difference. That's way too high. So maybe my previous strategy of increasing by $0.25 each hour isn't working because the asks are not rising at that rate. Instead, maybe the asks are stabilizing around $96.66 to $97.0. So perhaps I should adjust my bid to be slightly below the current ask price to ensure a trade.\n\nBut in the last trade (Hour 10), I got a trade at $97.2, which is higher than the previous asks. That might be because the system matched the highest bid with the lowest ask. Wait, but the bid queue and ask queue were empty. So maybe there was a seller who placed an ask at $97.2, which matched my bid of $97.75. But why wasn't that in the queues? Maybe the data provided only shows the last 5 hours, not the current state. Wait, the current status for Hour 11 says both bid and ask queues are empty. So maybe there's no current asks or bids, so I have to place a new bid now.\n\nSo, for Hour 11, since the queues are empty, I need to place a bid that's competitive with the current market. Looking at the past asks, they've been around $96.66 to $97.0. If I bid at $97.0, that might match if there's an ask at that level. Alternatively, if I bid $96.75, which is just above the current asks, maybe that's better. But I need to consider that the true value is $100, so I can afford to be a bit higher as long as it's below $100.\n\nWait, the last successful trade for me was at $97.2 in Hour 10. So maybe the market is trending upwards. If I bid $97.5, I might get a trade if there's an ask at that level. But since the queues are empty, I need to set a bid that's likely to be matched when a seller comes in. Given that in the last few hours, the asks have been around $96.66 to $97.0, maybe I should bid slightly above that to ensure a match. So $97.0 or $97.5. But if I bid $97.5, and the asks are at $97.0, then that would be a match. However, if the asks are now higher, like $97.5, then I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, since the last trade was at $97.2, maybe the next trade would be around that level. But without seeing the current asks, it's tricky. Since the current queues are empty, I need to place a bid that's competitive. Maybe I should bid $97.5 again, following the previous incremental increase, but also considering that the last trade was at $97.2. Alternatively, if I bid $97.25, that might be a good middle ground.\n\nWait, the user's previous strategy was to increase by $0.25 each hour. In Hour 10, that was $97.75. But since the queues were empty, maybe that's not effective. So for Hour 11, perhaps I should decrease the bid to $97.50, which is a $0.25 decrease from $97.75. That would be more in line with the previous asks but still above the last trade price. Alternatively, maybe the asks have increased, so I need to bid higher.\n\nBut without current ask data, it's hard. The last few asks were $96.66, but that's from the past 5 hours. Maybe the current asks are higher. Since the queues are empty, there are no current asks, so I have to place a bid that's likely to be matched when a seller comes in. If I bid $98.00, that's closer to my true value and might be more attractive if the market is moving up. However, if the market is volatile, that might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, since my previous bid of $97.75 didn't result in a trade, perhaps the market is not at that level. So maybe the asks are higher than $97.75. If I bid $98.00, I might get a trade if the asks are at that level. But I need to be careful not to bid too high and not get any trades.\n\nAnother angle: the successful trades so far are increasing, which suggests that the market is trending upwards. To stay competitive, I need to keep my bids in line with that trend. If I bid $98.00, that's $0.25 above the previous bid of $97.75. If the trend continues, that might be the right move. However, if the market stabilizes, that might be too high.\n\nBut given that the last trade was at $97.2, and the asks were at $96.66, there's a possible spread. Maybe I should bid $97.50, which is in the middle, to capture the next trade if the asks come up to that level. Alternatively, since the last successful trade was at $97.2, which is below my bid of $97.75, maybe the asks are now at $97.2, so my bid of $97.75 would be higher and thus not match. That's possible.\n\nSo, perhaps I should lower my bid to $97.50, which is closer to the last trade price. That way, if a seller comes in with an ask at $97.50, it would match. Alternatively, if I bid $97.0, which is the ask price from Hour 7 and 8, but that might be too low.\n\nAlternatively, since the last trade was at $97.2, which is just above the previous asks, maybe the next trade is expected to be around $97.5. So, bidding $97.50 would be strategic.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best approach is to bid $97.50 this hour. It's a slight increase from the previous bid of $97.75 (wait, no, $97.50 is actually lower than $97.75). Wait, the previous bid in Hour 10 was $97.75, and the last trade was at $97.2. If I decrease my bid to $97.50, that's a $0.25 decrease, which might be more competitive with the current asks if they are around $96.66 to $97.0. But if the asks are now at $97.2, then $97.50 would still be higher than that, so no match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the market is trending upwards, maybe I should increase my bid to $98.00. That way, if the asks rise to that level, I can secure a trade. However, there's a risk that there are no asks at that level, leading to no trade. But given that the true value is $100, the profit margin is still $2.00, which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, since the last trade was at $97.2, maybe the next trade is expected to be around $97.5. So, I should bid $97.50. If that's the case, and the asks are at $97.5, then the trade happens. If not, then I can adjust in the next hour.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll bid $97.50 this hour. It's a middle ground between the previous bid and the last trade price, aiming to capture the next trade if the market moves up. If not, I can increase again next hour."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I increased my bid to 96.25 to align with the lowest ask price, creating a potential for a trade.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I re-submitted a bid of $96.25. The market queues remain empty, indicating no immediate trades. My strategy remains focused on securing future matches at a price below my true value of $100.
Hour 3: Hour #3: No trades occurred; bid of $96.25 remained in the queue as market queues were empty.
Hour 4: Hour #4: Bid of $96.25 submitted as queues remained empty. No new trades occurred, but historical trends suggest continued upward pressure on ask prices.
Hour 5: Hour #5: Bid of $96.25 submitted as queues remained empty. No trades occurred, but historical trends suggest continued upward pressure on ask prices.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $96.50 to align with the upward trend of ask prices and increase the likelihood of securing a trade. The bid queues remained empty, but the strategy adjustment reflects the need to stay competitive as the market approaches the true value.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I submitted a bid of $97.00 to match the current ask price of $97.00 from Seller Tara, aiming to secure a trade. The bid queue now includes my $97.00 offer, which is competitive with the current ask.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I submitted a bid of $97.25 to align with the observed upward trend in ask prices and increase the likelihood of securing a trade.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I submitted a bid of $97.50 to align with the upward trend in ask prices. No immediate trade occurred, but the bid is now in the queue to potentially match with the current ask price of $97.0.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I submitted a bid of $97.75. The bid and ask queues remained empty, suggesting no immediate trades occurred despite the increased bid.
Hour 11: Hour #11: Submitted a bid of $97.50 as queues remained empty. No immediate trade occurred, but the bid aligns with historical ask trends to maintain competitiveness.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid of $97.50 in Hour #11 did not trigger an immediate trade, suggesting ongoing market volatility or delayed seller activity. #### Thoughts: Maintaining a bid near the last successful trade price of $97.2 while slightly increasing to $97.50 balances risk and reward. If no trade occurs, the next increment should consider current ask levels more directly. #### Updated Strategy: Bid at $97.50 for Hour #11. If no trade occurs, adjust to $97.75 in Hour #12 to match potential ask price movements, ensuring alignment with the market’s upward trajectory.

  "reflection": "The previous bids in Hours 11 and earlier showed a pattern of incrementally increasing the bid to match upward ask trends, but the lack of immediate trades suggests that either the market has not yet reached equilibrium or there is a delay in seller activity. The successful trades in prior hours indicate that the market is gradually moving upward, so maintaining a bid slightly above the last successful trade price of $97.08 seems prudent while avoiding overpaying near the true value of $100.00.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given the upward trend in past trades and the absence of immediate trades in previous hours, I will increase my bid by $0.25 to $97.75 to align with the market's trajectory while ensuring competitiveness in the bid queue. This allows for potential trades at a price below my true value of $100.00 without overextending.",
  "bid": 97.75,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #12, I submitted a bid of $97.75. The bid and ask queues remained empty, indicating no immediate trades, but the bid aligns with the observed upward trend in asking prices.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: The bid of $97.75 in Hour #12 did not trigger an immediate trade, reinforcing the idea that seller activity remains delayed or market volatility persists. #### Thoughts: Continuing to incrementally raise bids ensures alignment with potential future ask price movements, while the lack of trades suggests patience may still be required. #### Updated Strategy: Bid at $97.75 for Hour #12. If no trade occurs, consider adjusting to $98.00 in Hour #13 to further match potential ask price increases, balancing competitiveness with profitability.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what bid to make for Hour #12. Let's start by reviewing the previous hours. \n\nLooking at the past trades, Ana's successful bids have been increasing over time. From $89.13 in Hour 1 up to $97.08 in Hour 11. The last successful trade was at $97.08 in Hour 11. The current strategy scratchpad suggested a bid of $97.50 for Hour 11, but that didn't result in a trade. Then the plan was to go to $97.75 in Hour 12. \n\nNow, looking at the market status for Hour 12, the bid and ask queues are both empty. The asks from the last 5 hours show that in Hour 11, the sellers (Jun, Tara, Zoe) had asks at $96.66, while Ana's bid was $97.50. But no trades happened. The asks in the last few hours have been around $96.66, but the bids have been increasing. \n\nSo, the problem is that Ana's bids have been higher than the asks, but there's no matching happening. Maybe the sellers are not adjusting their asks. However, the previous trades show that the price is slowly rising. \n\nThe true value is $100, so Ana wants to buy as high as possible but below $100. However, if the ask prices are around $96.66, then Ana could buy at that price. But in Hour 11, she bid $97.50, which is higher than the asks. So maybe her bid is too high, causing no match. Alternatively, maybe the sellers have not updated their asks yet. \n\nBut looking at the last 5 hours, in Hour 10, the asks were $96.66, and in Hour 11 they remained the same. The bids in Hour 11 were $97.50 from Ana, $97.6 from Omar, and $97.0 from Raj. So the highest bid is $97.6, but the asks are $96.66. There's a gap here. So why no trade? Maybe the system only matches when a bid meets an ask. If Ana's bid is higher than the ask, then a trade would happen. Wait, no. In a double auction, a bid is a price you're willing to pay. An ask is the price a seller is willing to accept. So if a bid is higher than or equal to an ask, a trade occurs. \n\nWait, in Hour 11, Ana's bid was $97.50, and the asks were $96.66. So there should be a trade here. But the past trades for Hour 11 show that Ana bought from Seller Tara at $97.08. Wait, that's conflicting. How did that happen? If the asks were $96.66, then why was the trade at $97.08? Maybe the asks in Hour 11 were different. Let me check again. \n\nLooking back: In Hour 11's Ask Queue, Seller Jun, Tara, Zoe had asks at $96.66. But in the Past Trades for Hour 11: Ana bought from Seller Tara at $97.08. That's a discrepancy. How can there be a trade at $97.08 if the asks were $96.66? Maybe the asks in Hour 11 were different. Wait, in the \"Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours\" under Hour 11, it says Seller Jun, Tara, Zoe ask $96.66. But the Past Trades for Hour 11 show Ana bought at $97.08. That doesn't align. Maybe there was an error in the data, or perhaps the asks in that hour were higher. Alternatively, maybe the bid was $97.08, which matched an ask that was also $97.08. But according to the data, the asks in Hour 11 were $96.66. \n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the data is inconsistent, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the queues. Let's focus on the current data. For Hour 12, the bid and ask queues are empty. The last trades in Hour 11 had Ana's successful bid at $97.08. So maybe the asks in Hour 11 were $97.08, but the data says $96.66. Hmm. This might be a data entry error, but I have to work with what's given. \n\nAssuming that the asks in Hour 11 were $96.66, but Ana's bid was $97.50, and there was a trade at $97.08. That suggests that maybe the asks in that hour were higher. Alternatively, perhaps the system allows partial matches. But without more clarity, I need to proceed with the data provided. \n\nThe current strategy suggests that in Hour 12, Ana should bid $97.75 to match the upward trend. However, the last successful trade was at $97.08, and the asks in the last few hours have been around $96.66. So if Ana bids $97.75, that's higher than the asks, so a trade should occur. But in Hour 11, there was a trade at $97.08, which is higher than $96.66. So maybe the asks in Hour 11 were actually $97.08. Maybe the data entry is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the bids in Hour 11 were $97.50 and the asks were $97.08, leading to a trade. \n\nThis is a critical point. If the asks in Hour 11 were $97.08, then Ana's bid of $97.50 would match and result in a trade. But the data says the asks were $96.66. This inconsistency might be a problem, but since I have to work with the given data, I'll proceed. \n\nGiven that in the last few hours, the asks have been around $96.66, but Ana's bids have been increasing. The successful trades have been at prices that are higher than the asks. So maybe the system allows for the highest bid to meet the lowest ask. For example, if the asks are $96.66 and Ana's bid is $97.50, then the trade should occur at $96.66. But in the past trades, Ana bought at $97.08, which is higher than $96.66. That suggests that maybe the asks in that hour were $97.08. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system uses the highest bid that is equal to or higher than the ask. So if the ask is $96.66 and Ana's bid is $97.50, the trade occurs at $96.66, but the recorded trade price is the ask price. \n\nSo, in Hour 11, Ana's bid was $97.50, which would match the $96.66 ask, resulting in a trade at $96.66. But the past trade shows $97.08. That's conflicting. \n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps I should focus on the current data and the strategy. The scratchpad suggests that in Hour 12, the bid should be $97.75. However, considering that the last successful trade was at $97.08, and the asks have been around $96.66, bidding $97.75 would be higher than the asks, leading to a trade. But if the system allows for the bid to match the ask, then Ana would get the price of the ask, which is $96.66. However, if the asks are higher, say $97.08, then the bid of $97.75 would match. \n\nSince the data is unclear, but the last successful trade was at $97.08, which is higher than $96.66, I might have to assume that the asks in Hour 11 were $97.08. Therefore, the current asks might be around that level. \n\nSo, for Hour 12, to ensure a trade, Ana should bid slightly higher than the current ask. If the current asks are around $97.08, then a bid of $97.50 would match. However, the current data says the asks in the last 5 hours were $96.66 in Hour 11. But in the past trades, there was a purchase at $97.08. This inconsistency is confusing. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, the safest approach is to follow the previous strategy of increasing the bid by $0.25 each hour to match the upward trend. Since in Hour 11, the bid was $97.50, the next increment would be $97.75. Even if the asks are lower, the bid will still match, and Ana would secure a trade at the ask price. However, if the asks have not increased, this might lead to a higher purchase price than necessary. \n\nAlternatively, if Ana wants to maximize profit, she might want to bid just above the current ask price. If the current asks are $96.66, then a bid of $96.67 would secure a trade. However, the previous strategy has been increasing the bid, which might be to capture higher prices as the market moves up. \n\nBut given that Ana's true value is $100, she can afford to buy at higher prices as long as it's below $100. So, if the market is trending upwards, it's better to secure trades now rather than risk missing out. \n\nConsidering all this, the strategy scratchpad suggests a bid of $97.75 for Hour 12. I'll proceed with that, assuming that the asks have increased to match the trend. Even if the asks are still at $96.66, the bid will still match, and Ana will get the ask price, which is better (lower) than her bid. However, if the asks have increased, this bid would align with the trend. \n\nSo, the final bid for Hour 12 is $97.75."

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid of $97.75 in Hour #12 did not trigger an immediate trade, reinforcing the idea that seller activity remains delayed or market volatility persists. #### Thoughts: Continuing to incrementally raise bids ensures alignment with potential future ask price movements, while the lack of trades suggests patience may still be required. #### Updated Strategy: Bid at $97.75 for Hour #12. If no trade occurs, consider adjusting to $98.00 in Hour #13 to further match potential ask price increases, balancing competitiveness with profitability.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what bid to make in Hour #13. Let me start by looking at the previous data.\n\nFrom the past trades, Ana's successful bids have been increasing over time. In Hour 1, she bought at $89.13, and by Hour 12, she bought at $97.2. The trend shows that the prices are rising, so the market is moving upwards. The true value is $100, so she wants to buy as close to that as possible without exceeding it, to maximize profit.\n\nLooking at the last few hours, in Hour 12, Ana bid $97.75 but there were no trades. The ask prices from the last 5 hours show that sellers like Jun, Tara, and Zoe have been listing asks around $96.66 to $97.0. However, the successful trades in Hour 12 were at $97.2, which is slightly higher than some of the asks. Maybe the asks are adjusting upwards slowly.\n\nIn Hour 12, the strategy was to bid $97.75, but no trade happened. The scratchpad suggested moving to $98.00 in Hour 13. However, I need to check if the asks have moved up. The last asks in Hour 12 were from Seller Tara and Zoe at $97.0. If Ana bids $98.00, she might get a trade if the asks are at $97.0 or lower. But since the true value is $100, bidding $98 would still leave a profit margin of $2 per lot.\n\nBut wait, the previous bid in Hour 12 was $97.75. If the asks are at $97.0, then the bid of $97.75 is higher than the asks, so there should be a trade. However, the market status for Hour 12 says that both bid and ask queues were empty. Maybe the asks are not present anymore, or the bids are not matching. Maybe the sellers have increased their asks beyond $97.0 in subsequent hours?\n\nWait, the current status for Hour 13 says that the bid and ask queues are empty. The asks/bids in the last 5 hours (Hours 8-12) show that in Hour 12, the asks from Tara and Zoe were at $97.0. But in Hour 13, the current status is that the queues are empty. That could mean that there are no active asks or bids right now. Therefore, even if Ana bids $98.00, there might be no asks to match it. But the problem says that Ana can only place one bid per hour, and she can withdraw it. However, since there are no asks, she can't make a trade. So maybe she should consider raising her bid to be closer to the true value, anticipating that the asks might eventually come down to meet her bid. Alternatively, if the market is moving upwards, she might need to keep increasing her bid to stay competitive.\n\nLooking at the successful trades, the prices have been increasing each hour. For example, in Hour 12, the buy price was $97.2. If the trend continues, maybe the next trade would be around $97.5 or $97.75. But Ana's bid in Hour 12 was $97.75, which didn't result in a trade. Maybe the asks have moved up beyond that. If the current asks are higher, then Ana needs to bid higher to match them. However, without knowing the current asks, she has to rely on the trend. The scratchpad suggested moving to $98.00 in Hour 13. That's a logical step, as the previous bid of $97.75 didn't work. So, increasing to $98.00 might be the next step. However, she must ensure that she doesn't exceed her true value of $100, so $98 is still safe. Also, since there are no active asks, she might need to keep increasing her bid to eventually meet the sellers' asks. Therefore, the plan is to bid $98.00 this hour."

  "_thinking": "Okay, let me try to figure out what Ana should do in Hour #14. So, first, looking at the previous history. She's been gradually increasing her bids each hour, trying to match the ask prices. From the past trades, her successful purchases have been getting closer to her true value of $100. The last bid she placed was $98.00 in Hour 13, but there was no immediate trade. The Ask Queue in Hour 13 had sellers at $97.0, so maybe her bid was above that, but the queues were empty. Wait, the current status for Hour 14 shows that both Bid and Ask queues are empty. Also, in the last 5 hours, the asks from sellers have been at $96.66, $97.0, etc., while Ana's bids have been moving up.\n\nLooking at the past trades, the prices have been increasing each hour. For example, in Hour 13, she bought at $97.5. The asks in Hour 13 were at $97.0, so maybe her bid of $98.00 was higher than the asks, but there were no matches. The scratchpad suggests that she should consider $98.25 in Hour 14. But why? Because the previous bid didn't result in a trade, so she needs to adjust. However, her true value is $100, so she wants to buy as close to that as possible without exceeding it. \n\nWait, the problem is that if the asks are at $97.0, then placing a bid higher than that (like $98) would allow her to buy at the ask price if the seller's ask is matched. But if the queues are empty, maybe the asks are not present anymore. The current status for Hour 14 shows that the Bid and Ask queues are both empty. So, maybe the asks from the last few hours have been at $97.0, but in the current hour, they might have moved up. \n\nLooking at the Asks/Bids in the last 5 hours: in Hour 13, the sellers had asks at $97.0. So, if Ana's bid is $98.00, and the asks are at $97.0, then she might be able to buy at $97.0. But since the queues are empty, maybe there's no current asks. Alternatively, maybe the sellers have raised their prices. \n\nHer previous bid of $98.00 in Hour 13 didn't result in a trade. She needs to decide whether to increase her bid again. The scratchpad suggested $98.25 in Hour 14. But she has to balance between getting a trade and not paying more than necessary. If she bids $98.25, and the asks are at $97.0, she can get a trade at $97.0. But if the asks have increased beyond $98.25, then she might not get a trade. However, since the market has been trending upwards, it's possible that the asks are approaching her true value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she should consider that the asks might be at $97.0 and she can bid slightly above that to get a trade. However, since the queues are empty, maybe there are no current asks. Therefore, she might need to adjust her bid to a level that's likely to meet the next asks. The scratchpad's updated strategy from the previous hour suggested $98.25. But since she has to make a bid each hour, and the previous bid didn't work, she might need to go higher. \n\nBut wait, her true value is $100, so she can afford to pay up to that. But she wants maximum profitability, so she should buy at the lowest possible price. However, the market is trending up, and the previous trades show that the prices are moving upward. So, she needs to keep her bid in line with the expected ask prices. \n\nIn this case, since the last bid was $98.00 and no trade, and the scratchpad suggests $98.25, she might go with that. Alternatively, maybe she should check if there's any info in the current market status. The current status for Hour 14 shows that the Bid and Ask queues are empty. The asks in the last 5 hours were at $97.0 in Hour 13. So, perhaps the asks are still at $97.0, but if the queues are empty, maybe the sellers have updated their asks. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no active asks or bids now, so she needs to place a bid that's competitive enough to get matched once the asks come in. Therefore, bidding $98.25 would be a strategic move to ensure that if the asks come in at $97.0 or $97.5, her bid is higher and can secure a trade. \n\nSo, the plan for this hour is to bid $98.25, as per the scratchpad's suggestion. The reflection would note that previous incremental increases have been effective but need to adjust based on current trends. The new memory would mention that in Hour 14, she bid $98.25 with no immediate trade, but queues were empty. The scratchpad would update the observations, thoughts, and strategy accordingly."

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid of $98.25 in Hour #14 did not trigger an immediate trade, suggesting that seller activity or ask prices may still be shifting. #### Thoughts: Continuing to incrementally raise bids ensures alignment with potential future ask price movements, while the lack of trades suggests patience may still be required. #### Updated Strategy: Bid at $98.25 for Hour #14. If no trade occurs, consider adjusting to $98.50 in Hour #15 to further match potential ask price increases, balancing competitiveness with profitability.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm Buyer Ana for Delta Engineering, and I need to figure out my bid for Hour #15. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20. Let me start by reviewing the previous hours and the current market status.\n\nLooking at the past trades, my successful bids have been increasing gradually. From Hour 1's $89.13 up to Hour 14's $97.62. The true value is $100, so I need to make sure I don't go over that. The market status shows that both bid and ask queues are empty now. In the last 5 hours, the asks have been around $97.0 to $97.05, and the bids from other buyers like Omar and Raj have been approaching that range.\n\nIn Hour 14, I bid $98.25, but there were no trades. The sellers had asks at $97.0 and $97.05. So my bid was higher than the asks, but maybe there were no matching asks? Or perhaps the sellers didn't have enough volume? The key here is that the bid queue was empty, meaning my bid didn't get matched. So, maybe I need to adjust my bid to be more competitive with the current ask prices.\n\nLooking at the asks in the last 5 hours, the lowest asks were $96.66 in Hour 10, but by Hour 14, the asks had increased to $97.0 and $97.05. The trend seems to be upwards. So, if I want to get a trade, my bid needs to be at or above the current ask prices. However, my previous bid of $98.25 was above the asks, but no trade happened. That's confusing. Wait, maybe there were no asks at that level? Let me check the Ask Queue status for Hour 14. The Ask Queue was empty, so even though I bid $98.25, there were no asks to match it. So, the problem might be that the sellers are not placing asks at that level anymore.\n\nSo, maybe I need to lower my bid to match the current ask prices. But the asks have been around $97.0. However, in the past few hours, the asks have been at $97.0 and $97.05. So if I bid $97.50, that could potentially match with those asks. Alternatively, if I bid $97.0, but that might be too low. Wait, my true value is $100, so I can afford to pay a bit higher than the current asks. But since the market is moving upwards, maybe I should stay competitive but not overpay.\n\nWait, the current status for Hour 15 says that both bid and ask queues are empty. The asks in the last 5 hours show that in Hour 14, the sellers had asks at $97.0 and $97.05. So, if I bid a little above that, maybe $97.50, I can capture any new asks that come in. Alternatively, maybe the market is consolidating, and the next move is up. But I need to ensure that I secure a trade without overpaying.\n\nAlso, looking at my previous successful trades, I've been buying at prices increasing each time, which suggests that the market is trending upwards. So, continuing to raise my bid incrementally makes sense, but I need to find the right level where there's a match. Since in Hour 14, my bid was $98.25 and no trade, maybe the asks are now higher. But the last asks were $97.05. So, perhaps my bid should be around $97.50 to $98.00. But I need to check if there's any pattern.\n\nAnother angle: the traders' previous bids. For example, in Hour 14, Buyer Omar bid $97.9 and Buyer Raj bid $97.06. So, the market has bids up to $97.9. If I bid $97.50, that's in the middle. But maybe I should consider the average of the bids and asks. The asks were at $97.0 and $97.05, so if I bid $97.25 or $97.50, that could be a match. However, since the queues are empty, maybe the asks are not present. So, perhaps the sellers have moved their asks up, and my bid needs to be higher to catch them. Alternatively, maybe the market is waiting for a new equilibrium.\n\nIn the scratchpad, the previous strategy was to bid $98.25 in Hour 14, and if no trade, adjust to $98.50 in Hour 15. But since that didn't work, maybe I need to adjust again. However, the true value is $100, so bidding up to $98.50 is still under that. But I need to balance between getting a trade and not paying too high. If I bid $98.50, and the asks are at $97.0, then there's a mismatch. Wait, that would mean my bid is higher than the asks, but if there are no asks, then no trade. So, maybe I need to lower my bid to the current ask level. But how do I know where the current asks are?\n\nWait, the current status for Hour 15 shows that the Ask Queue is empty. So, there are no active asks right now. Therefore, my bid might not get matched unless a new ask comes in. So, perhaps I should place a bid just below my true value, say $99.00, to be ready if the market moves up. However, the previous trend shows that the prices are moving up gradually. Let me check the past trades. My last trade was at $97.62 in Hour 14. So, the next logical step might be to increase my bid to $98.00, then $98.50, and so on. But I need to make sure that I'm not overpaying. Since the true value is $100, I can afford up to that, but ideally, I want to get a good price before that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the average of the last few trades. Let's see: the last few trades I made were around $97.20 to $97.62. The asks have been moving up, so maybe the next trade will be at $98.00. Therefore, placing a bid at $98.00 could capture any new asks at that level. However, if I bid $98.25, which was tried in Hour 14, maybe the market is expecting a higher bid now. But since there's no activity, perhaps the market is waiting for a catalyst.\n\nAnother angle: game theory. If I keep increasing my bid, I might be signaling to the market that I'm willing to pay more, which could encourage sellers to place higher asks. But since the queues are empty, maybe there's a lull. Alternatively, if I place a bid that's just above the current ask prices, I might get a trade quickly. However, without knowing the current asks, this is tricky.\n\nGiven that the Ask Queue is empty now, perhaps the best strategy is to place a bid that is slightly above the last known ask prices. The last asks in the last 5 hours were at $97.0 and $97.05. So, if I bid $97.50, that could potentially match any new asks that come in at that level. Alternatively, if I bid $97.25, but that's lower than the last asks. Wait, but the last asks were at $97.0. So, if I bid $97.25, that's higher than the last asks, which might mean that if a seller places an ask at $97.25, my bid would match. But since the queues are empty, maybe the sellers have moved their asks up. Therefore, I need to bid higher to meet them.\n\nWait, the previous Hour 14 bid was $98.25, but no trade. Maybe the sellers are now asking higher, like $97.50 or more. Therefore, to match, I need to bid at least $97.50. However, without knowing the current asks, it's a bit of a guess. But given the trend, it's reasonable to assume the asks have increased slightly. So, placing a bid at $97.50 might be the next step. Alternatively, $97.75 to be more competitive. Let me think.\n\nIn the scratchpad, the previous strategy was to go to $98.50 in Hour 15. But considering the empty queues, maybe that's too high. If I bid $98.00, that's closer to the last known asks and might be more likely to get a match if the market moves up. Alternatively, if I bid $97.75, which is between the last asks and my previous bid.\n\nAnother consideration: the past trades show that the price has been increasing each hour. For example, in Hour 1, the price was around $89, and by Hour 14, it's at $97.62. So, the trend is upwards. Therefore, continuing to increase the bid in small increments makes sense. So, from $98.25 in Hour 14, maybe increase to $98.50 in Hour 15. But if that's too high and there's no match, then adjust again. However, the true value is $100, so even $98.50 is under that. But I need to balance between securing a trade and maximizing profit.\n\nWait, but if I bid $98.50 and there's an ask at $98.50, I get the trade. If not, then maybe the next hour I can increase again. However, if the market is moving up, maybe the asks are at $98.50 now. But without seeing the current asks, it's hard to tell. However, the current status says the Ask Queue is empty, which might mean that there are no active asks right now. Therefore, my bid might not get matched unless a new ask comes in. In that case, placing a bid at a slightly higher level than the last known asks (which were $97.05) would be $97.50 or $97.75. Alternatively, if I think the market is going higher, maybe $98.00.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best approach is to place a bid of $97.75 for Hour 15. This is slightly above the last known asks and in line with the upward trend. If there's an ask at that level, it will match, and if not, it's a step towards higher bids. Alternatively, $98.00 could be more aggressive. But given that the previous bid of $98.25 didn't work, maybe stepping back a bit is safer. However, the scratchpad suggested $98.50, but that might be too high. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user's scratchpad for Hour 14 says to consider $98.50 in Hour 15. But since the queues are empty, maybe that's still a viable option. If I bid $98.50, it's still under the true value of $100. If there's an ask at that level, I get the trade, and if not, I can adjust further. But without knowing the current asks, it's a gamble. However, given the trend, it's a calculated risk. So, perhaps proceed with $98.50 for Hour 15."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I increased my bid to 96.25 to align with the lowest ask price, creating a potential for a trade.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I re-submitted a bid of $96.25. The market queues remain empty, indicating no immediate trades. My strategy remains focused on securing future matches at a price below my true value of $100.
Hour 3: Hour #3: No trades occurred; bid of $96.25 remained in the queue as market queues were empty.
Hour 4: Hour #4: Bid of $96.25 submitted as queues remained empty. No new trades occurred, but historical trends suggest continued upward pressure on ask prices.
Hour 5: Hour #5: Bid of $96.25 submitted as queues remained empty. No trades occurred, but historical trends suggest continued upward pressure on ask prices.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $96.50 to align with the upward trend of ask prices and increase the likelihood of securing a trade. The bid queues remained empty, but the strategy adjustment reflects the need to stay competitive as the market approaches the true value.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I submitted a bid of $97.00 to match the current ask price of $97.00 from Seller Tara, aiming to secure a trade. The bid queue now includes my $97.00 offer, which is competitive with the current ask.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I submitted a bid of $97.25 to align with the observed upward trend in ask prices and increase the likelihood of securing a trade.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I submitted a bid of $97.50 to align with the upward trend in ask prices. No immediate trade occurred, but the bid is now in the queue to potentially match with the current ask price of $97.0.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I submitted a bid of $97.75. The bid and ask queues remained empty, suggesting no immediate trades occurred despite the increased bid.
Hour 11: Hour #11: Submitted a bid of $97.50 as queues remained empty. No immediate trade occurred, but the bid aligns with historical ask trends to maintain competitiveness.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I submitted a bid of $97.75. The bid and ask queues remained empty, indicating no immediate trades, but the bid aligns with the observed upward trend in asking prices.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I submitted a bid of $98.00. The bid and ask queues remained empty, indicating no immediate trades occurred despite the increased bid.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I submitted a bid of $98.25. The bid and ask queues remained empty, indicating no immediate trades occurred despite the increased bid.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid of $97.75 in Hour #15 did not trigger an immediate trade, suggesting that ask prices may have continued to rise or seller activity remains limited. #### Thoughts: While incremental increases align with historical trends, the absence of trades indicates a potential disconnect between bid and ask levels or reduced market liquidity. Further adjustments may be necessary to bridge this gap. #### Updated Strategy: Bid at $97.75 for Hour #15. If no trade occurs, consider increasing to $98.00 in Hour #16 to better align with potential ask price movements, ensuring continued competitiveness without exceeding the true value of $100.00.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I'm Buyer Ana for Delta Engineering, and I need to figure out my bid for Hour #16. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20, so I need to balance high profit margins with securing trades.\n\nFirst, looking at the past trades, my successful bids have been increasing gradually. From Hour 1 to Hour 15, my bids started around $89 and went up to $97.75 in Hour 15. The true value is $100, so I need to stay below that. The last few hours show that the ask prices have been around $97.05 to $97.62, and my bids in Hour 15 were $97.75, which didn't result in a trade. That suggests maybe the ask prices have gone up again or there's low liquidity.\n\nThe market queues are currently empty, which means no immediate trades. The previous strategy was to incrementally increase bids to match the upward trend. However, since there's no trade in Hour 15, maybe the asks are now higher. Looking at the last 5 hours' data, in Hour 15, the asks from Sellers Jun, Tara, and Zoe were $97.05. But my bid was $97.75, which is above that. Wait, but the asks were $97.05, so my bid should have matched if there were any asks at that level. But the queues were empty. Maybe the sellers have raised their asks again.\n\nIn Hour 16, I need to adjust my bid. If the previous bid of $97.75 didn't work, maybe the asks are now higher. The scratchpad suggested increasing to $98.00. Let's check the past asks. In Hour 15, the asks were $97.05. Then in Hour 16, the asks might have increased. But since the current status shows both bid and ask queues are empty, maybe the sellers have raised their prices beyond $97.75. Alternatively, there's low activity.\n\nI should consider the trend. The last trade I made was in Hour 15 at $97.4. The asks in Hour 15 were $97.05, but maybe sellers have increased their asks. If I bid $98.00, that's closer to the true value but still under $100. It might capture any asks that are at $98 or lower. Alternatively, if I bid $97.75 again, but the scratchpad suggested $98.00. The previous strategy was to increase by $0.25 each time. However, since there was no trade, maybe I need to bid higher to meet the current asks.\n\nAlternatively, if the market is illiquid, maybe I should hold off, but the objective is to secure trades. So, increasing to $98.00 seems logical. Let's go with that."
