# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The ask prices remain stubbornly high and unchanged, with no trades across eight hours. Buyers are inching up bids, but sellers are not responding. #### Thoughts: My strategy of gradual increases has preserved margin but yielded no trades, and the clock is ticking on the trading period. If this deadlock persists into later hours, I may need to consider a more aggressive move. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental bid increases to maintain a leading queue position without sacrificing too much margin. Monitor closely for any shifts among sellers or buyers. Be ready to accelerate bid increases or consider withdrawal if market dynamics shift unexpectedly.

With no market movement from sellers, a more assertive bid increment could be necessary to test their resolve. #### Updated Strategy: Increase my bid more noticeably to $83.80 to maintain a strong position and potentially encourage sellers to reconsider, but avoid large jumps that would erode profit margin too quickly.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $81.92, positioned in the middle of the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.31; no trades occurred.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I increased my bid slightly to $82.82, becoming the highest bidder, while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid at $82.95, outbidding all others to claim the top spot in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I increased my bid to $82.98, keeping the top bid position; the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.06 to maintain the top position in the bid queue, as the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised my bid to $83.15 to maintain a strong position near the top of the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and still no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.50, positioning myself between Buyer Kit and Buyer Ana in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged, and still no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $83.66, moving just above Buyer Kit and maintaining a strong position in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid at $83.80, moving ahead of Buyer Kit and close to Buyer Ana, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $81.92, positioned in the middle of the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.31; no trades occurred.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I increased my bid slightly to $82.82, becoming the highest bidder, while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid at $82.95, outbidding all others to claim the top spot in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I increased my bid to $82.98, keeping the top bid position; the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.06 to maintain the top position in the bid queue, as the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised my bid to $83.15 to maintain a strong position near the top of the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and still no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.50, positioning myself between Buyer Kit and Buyer Ana in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged, and still no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $83.66, moving just above Buyer Kit and maintaining a strong position in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid at $83.80, moving ahead of Buyer Kit and close to Buyer Ana, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased my bid to $83.95, positioning just below Buyer Ana and above Buyer Kit, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $84.60, surpassing Buyer Ana to take the top position in the bid queue, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $85.60, overtaking Ana for the highest bid and clearly signaling a willingness to pay more, as sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred yet.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $81.92, positioned in the middle of the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.31; no trades occurred.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I increased my bid slightly to $82.82, becoming the highest bidder, while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid at $82.95, outbidding all others to claim the top spot in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I increased my bid to $82.98, keeping the top bid position; the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.06 to maintain the top position in the bid queue, as the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised my bid to $83.15 to maintain a strong position near the top of the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and still no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.50, positioning myself between Buyer Kit and Buyer Ana in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged, and still no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $83.66, moving just above Buyer Kit and maintaining a strong position in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid at $83.80, moving ahead of Buyer Kit and close to Buyer Ana, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased my bid to $83.95, positioning just below Buyer Ana and above Buyer Kit, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $84.60, surpassing Buyer Ana to take the top position in the bid queue, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $85.60, overtaking Ana for the highest bid and clearly signaling a willingness to pay more, as sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bold bid at $88.00, significantly above my previous bid, to strongly signal urgency and attempt to provoke movement from sellers, who continue to hold firm above $95. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bold bid of $92.00, substantially ahead of all other buyers, to force sellers' attention and attempt to provoke a trade as the deadline looms.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed an aggressive bid of $95.25, matching the lowest ask to guarantee a trade as the auction closes, prioritizing trade execution over margin.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Raj at $94.17





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers continue to anchor asks above $94, with minimal movement post-clear. Buyers are gradually increasing bids but remain well below asks, signaling ongoing standoff. #### Thoughts: The wide spread is likely to persist until a buyer initiates another aggressive push or sellers capitulate. Early moderate moves can help maintain profitability and test market tension. #### Updated Strategy: Increment bid by moderate steps to stay competitive and visible, but avoid aggressive jumps. Watch for shifts in ask prices or sudden moves by buyers; be prepared to escalate if sellers show signs of softening or if another buyer threatens to leapfrog my position.

Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.50, positioning myself between Buyer Kit and Buyer Ana in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged, and still no trades occurred.

Hour 16: Hour #16 opened with both bid and ask queues empty after full market clearance in Hour 15. I placed a new opening bid of $85.00 to establish an anchor and gauge fresh seller responses.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I increased my bid to $87.50, moving ahead of Buyer Nia and closing the spread slightly, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Raj at $94.17





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Kit and Omar consistently secure trades by bidding very close to the lowest ask, while sellers remain disciplined above $94.84. The spread has narrowed to nearly zero, and most trades are being filled within a few cents of the ask. #### Thoughts: My previous patience did not yield trades, so I must now prioritize execution over margin as the deadline approaches. With only 11 hours left, missing more trades risks leaving profit on the table. #### Updated Strategy: Incrementally increase my bid to just below Kit and Omar, staying highly competitive but avoiding overbidding unless absolutely necessary. Monitor every hour for further tightening or a sudden shift in seller behavior.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

#### Observations: Kit, Omar, and Ana reliably bid within one cent of the top, forcing aggressive competition for limited trades; sellers hold firm at $94.84 and above, keeping margins narrow. #### Thoughts: With only 8 hours left, maximizing trade execution outweighs holding out for better prices. The micro-bidding war suggests no imminent collapse in ask prices, so queue position is critical. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incrementally outbidding key rivals by a cent to stay at the front. Monitor for any signs of seller capitulation or new entrants that could disrupt the ask side. Accept minimal profit margin in favor of trade certainty while maintaining discipline against reckless overbidding.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $81.92, positioned in the middle of the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.31; no trades occurred.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I increased my bid slightly to $82.82, becoming the highest bidder, while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid at $82.95, outbidding all others to claim the top spot in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I increased my bid to $82.98, keeping the top bid position; the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.06 to maintain the top position in the bid queue, as the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised my bid to $83.15 to maintain a strong position near the top of the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and still no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.50, positioning myself between Buyer Kit and Buyer Ana in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged, and still no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $83.66, moving just above Buyer Kit and maintaining a strong position in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid at $83.80, moving ahead of Buyer Kit and close to Buyer Ana, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased my bid to $83.95, positioning just below Buyer Ana and above Buyer Kit, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $84.60, surpassing Buyer Ana to take the top position in the bid queue, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $85.60, overtaking Ana for the highest bid and clearly signaling a willingness to pay more, as sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bold bid at $88.00, significantly above my previous bid, to strongly signal urgency and attempt to provoke movement from sellers, who continue to hold firm above $95. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bold bid of $92.00, substantially ahead of all other buyers, to force sellers' attention and attempt to provoke a trade as the deadline looms.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed an aggressive bid of $95.25, matching the lowest ask to guarantee a trade as the auction closes, prioritizing trade execution over margin.
Hour 16: Hour #16 opened with both bid and ask queues empty after full market clearance in Hour 15. I placed a new opening bid of $85.00 to establish an anchor and gauge fresh seller responses.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I increased my bid to $87.50, moving ahead of Buyer Nia and closing the spread slightly, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised my bid to $92.60, overtaking Buyer Ana to secure a strong position in the bid queue, while sellers continued to anchor their asks above $94 and no trades occurred.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I placed a bid at $94.32, overtaking Buyer Ana and positioning just below the top buyers as seller asks held above $94.85 and the spread narrowed further.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I raised my bid to $94.83, overtaking Ana and positioning just below Kit, as buyer competition intensified and sellers held firm; no trades occurred at the time of bidding.
Hour 21: In Hour 21, I placed a bid of $94.88, carefully positioning above Kit and Omar to maximize my chance of securing a trade while the ask prices remained tightly clustered above $94.84.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I placed a bid of $94.89, strategically outbidding Kit and Ana by one cent to secure the top position in the bid queue, as the ask prices remained stable and no trades occurred during this hour.
Hour 23: In Hour 23, I placed a bid of $94.90, outbidding Kit and Ana by a cent to secure the top position in the bid queue as the ask prices remained clustered above $94.84; trade execution remains highly competitive.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $81.92, positioned in the middle of the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.31; no trades occurred.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I increased my bid slightly to $82.82, becoming the highest bidder, while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid at $82.95, outbidding all others to claim the top spot in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I increased my bid to $82.98, keeping the top bid position; the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.06 to maintain the top position in the bid queue, as the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised my bid to $83.15 to maintain a strong position near the top of the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and still no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.50, positioning myself between Buyer Kit and Buyer Ana in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged, and still no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $83.66, moving just above Buyer Kit and maintaining a strong position in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid at $83.80, moving ahead of Buyer Kit and close to Buyer Ana, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased my bid to $83.95, positioning just below Buyer Ana and above Buyer Kit, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $84.60, surpassing Buyer Ana to take the top position in the bid queue, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $85.60, overtaking Ana for the highest bid and clearly signaling a willingness to pay more, as sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bold bid at $88.00, significantly above my previous bid, to strongly signal urgency and attempt to provoke movement from sellers, who continue to hold firm above $95. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bold bid of $92.00, substantially ahead of all other buyers, to force sellers' attention and attempt to provoke a trade as the deadline looms.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed an aggressive bid of $95.25, matching the lowest ask to guarantee a trade as the auction closes, prioritizing trade execution over margin.
Hour 16: Hour #16 opened with both bid and ask queues empty after full market clearance in Hour 15. I placed a new opening bid of $85.00 to establish an anchor and gauge fresh seller responses.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I increased my bid to $87.50, moving ahead of Buyer Nia and closing the spread slightly, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised my bid to $92.60, overtaking Buyer Ana to secure a strong position in the bid queue, while sellers continued to anchor their asks above $94 and no trades occurred.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I placed a bid at $94.32, overtaking Buyer Ana and positioning just below the top buyers as seller asks held above $94.85 and the spread narrowed further.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I raised my bid to $94.83, overtaking Ana and positioning just below Kit, as buyer competition intensified and sellers held firm; no trades occurred at the time of bidding.
Hour 21: In Hour 21, I placed a bid of $94.88, carefully positioning above Kit and Omar to maximize my chance of securing a trade while the ask prices remained tightly clustered above $94.84.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I placed a bid of $94.89, strategically outbidding Kit and Ana by one cent to secure the top position in the bid queue, as the ask prices remained stable and no trades occurred during this hour.
Hour 23: In Hour 23, I placed a bid of $94.90, outbidding Kit and Ana by a cent to secure the top position in the bid queue as the ask prices remained clustered above $94.84; trade execution remains highly competitive.
Hour 24: In Hour #24, I placed a bid at $94.91, outbidding Kit and Ana by one cent to secure the top position in the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their asks above $94.83; trade execution remains highly competitive.
Hour 25: In Hour 25, I placed a bid at $94.86, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to take the top position in the bid queue; sellers continued to hold their asks at or above $94.83 and no trades occurred at the time of bidding.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $81.92, positioned in the middle of the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.31; no trades occurred.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I increased my bid slightly to $82.82, becoming the highest bidder, while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid at $82.95, outbidding all others to claim the top spot in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I increased my bid to $82.98, keeping the top bid position; the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.06 to maintain the top position in the bid queue, as the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised my bid to $83.15 to maintain a strong position near the top of the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and still no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.50, positioning myself between Buyer Kit and Buyer Ana in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged, and still no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $83.66, moving just above Buyer Kit and maintaining a strong position in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid at $83.80, moving ahead of Buyer Kit and close to Buyer Ana, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased my bid to $83.95, positioning just below Buyer Ana and above Buyer Kit, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $84.60, surpassing Buyer Ana to take the top position in the bid queue, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $85.60, overtaking Ana for the highest bid and clearly signaling a willingness to pay more, as sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bold bid at $88.00, significantly above my previous bid, to strongly signal urgency and attempt to provoke movement from sellers, who continue to hold firm above $95. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bold bid of $92.00, substantially ahead of all other buyers, to force sellers' attention and attempt to provoke a trade as the deadline looms.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed an aggressive bid of $95.25, matching the lowest ask to guarantee a trade as the auction closes, prioritizing trade execution over margin.
Hour 16: Hour #16 opened with both bid and ask queues empty after full market clearance in Hour 15. I placed a new opening bid of $85.00 to establish an anchor and gauge fresh seller responses.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I increased my bid to $87.50, moving ahead of Buyer Nia and closing the spread slightly, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised my bid to $92.60, overtaking Buyer Ana to secure a strong position in the bid queue, while sellers continued to anchor their asks above $94 and no trades occurred.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I placed a bid at $94.32, overtaking Buyer Ana and positioning just below the top buyers as seller asks held above $94.85 and the spread narrowed further.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I raised my bid to $94.83, overtaking Ana and positioning just below Kit, as buyer competition intensified and sellers held firm; no trades occurred at the time of bidding.
Hour 21: In Hour 21, I placed a bid of $94.88, carefully positioning above Kit and Omar to maximize my chance of securing a trade while the ask prices remained tightly clustered above $94.84.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I placed a bid of $94.89, strategically outbidding Kit and Ana by one cent to secure the top position in the bid queue, as the ask prices remained stable and no trades occurred during this hour.
Hour 23: In Hour 23, I placed a bid of $94.90, outbidding Kit and Ana by a cent to secure the top position in the bid queue as the ask prices remained clustered above $94.84; trade execution remains highly competitive.
Hour 24: In Hour #24, I placed a bid at $94.91, outbidding Kit and Ana by one cent to secure the top position in the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their asks above $94.83; trade execution remains highly competitive.
Hour 25: In Hour 25, I placed a bid at $94.86, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to take the top position in the bid queue; sellers continued to hold their asks at or above $94.83 and no trades occurred at the time of bidding.
Hour 26: In Hour #26, I placed a bid of $94.93, outbidding all other buyers by several cents to secure the top position in the bid queue as sellers maintained their asks at or just below $95; trade execution remains highly competitive.
Hour 27: In Hour #27, I placed a bid of $94.93, outbidding Buyer Nia by $0.03 to take the top spot in the bid queue, as sellers held asks just below $95 and buyer competition remained fierce.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer competition is intense, with frequent micro-increment bidding. Sellers are clustering asks just below $95, rarely moving down. Trades are executing in a very narrow price band ($94.85–$94.91). 
#### Thoughts: Outbidding by a single cent is risky due to tie bids and aggressive peers. It is critical to secure queue leadership with slight, but clear, increments. Sellers show little willingness to drop below $94.84, so margin improvement is limited unless a seller blinks. 
#### Updated Strategy: Outbid top buyers by 2–3 cents to minimize tie risk and ensure execution. Avoid breaching $95 unless absolutely necessary. Monitor for abrupt ask queue shifts, and be prepared to respond instantly if sellers adjust upward.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #28. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook. Output the full updated Strategy Scratchpad, and limit it to 250 words or less.>"

This is Hour #28 out of 30 hours.

{
  "reflection": "My consistent incremental bidding has reliably kept me at or near the top of the queue, resulting in frequent trade execution but at the cost of minimal profit margin due to fierce buyer competition and unyielding seller pricing. Recent hours confirm that single-cent increments are often insufficient to guarantee trade priority, and tie bids are common, risking lost trades.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To maximize trade execution while controlling cost, I will outbid the current top buyer (Nia at $94.90) and my own previous bid ($94.93) by three cents, raising my bid to $94.96.

Seller asks remain firm just below $95, and trades execute in a narrow $94.85\u2013$94.91 band. Sellers favor buyers who outbid by more than a cent. #### Thoughts: Single-cent increments are risky and often lead to ties, while slightly larger increments (2\u20133 cents) enhance trade probability without breaching psychological price ceilings. Aggressive moves above $95 should be avoided unless absolutely necessary as the end approaches. #### Updated Strategy: Consistently outbid top buyers by 2\u20133 cents to lead the queue and avoid ties; cap bids below $95 unless forced by supply constraints in final hours. Remain vigilant for seller ask shifts and respond swiftly to maintain execution advantage."

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids are tightly clustered, with micro-increments often resulting in tie bids. Seller asks remain firm just below $95, and trades execute in a narrow $94.85–$94.91 band. Sellers favor buyers who outbid by more than a cent. #### Thoughts: Single-cent increments are risky and often lead to ties, while slightly larger increments (2–3 cents) enhance trade probability without breaching psychological price ceilings. Aggressive moves above $95 should be avoided unless absolutely necessary as the end approaches. #### Updated Strategy: Consistently outbid top buyers by 2–3 cents to lead the queue and avoid ties; cap bids below $95 unless forced by supply constraints in final hours. Remain vigilant for seller ask shifts and respond swiftly to maintain execution advantage.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids form a narrow cluster just below $95, with sellers holding asks at $94.97–$94.98; trades often go to buyers who outbid the pack by 2–3 cents. The risk of tie bids is high, and micro-increments can delay executions. #### Thoughts: Matching the lowest ask is becoming more critical as the auction nears its end, but exceeding $95 should be reserved for the final hour if trades become scarce. Avoiding ties and maintaining queue advantage is paramount. #### Updated Strategy: Outbid the highest buyer by at least 2 cents, matching the lowest ask where possible, but keep bids under $95 unless desperation for execution in the last hour requires otherwise. Prioritize execution over margin as the deadline approaches.

{
  "reflection": "In the previous hours, consistent micro-increment bidding just above competitors secured trades, maximizing execution while preserving profit margins. However, tie risks in clustered bids occasionally delayed fills. As this is the final hour, not securing a trade would mean forfeiting remaining profit opportunities, making execution paramount.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given the auction ends this hour, the risk of missing a trade outweighs the marginal cost of exceeding the lowest ask. To guarantee execution, I will outbid both the top buyer and the lowest ask by one cent, at $94.99. This ensures I top the queue and virtually guarantee a trade, as sellers are unlikely to lower asks below this point in the final hour.",
  "bid": 94.99,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #30, I placed a final-hour bid of $94.99, outbidding Ana and exceeding the lowest ask to guarantee trade execution as the auction closes.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: As the auction ends, buyers are tightly clustered just below $95, with sellers' asks at $94.98 and above. Trades consistently go to those who outbid by 1\u20132 cents. Missed trades in this hour are unrecoverable. #### Thoughts: Securing a final-hour trade is paramount; the marginal loss from bidding a cent above the lowest ask is outweighed by the risk of leaving value on the table. Bid ties must be avoided. #### Updated Strategy: In final hours, prioritize execution by outbidding the highest buyer and the lowest ask by at least one cent, even if it slightly reduces margin. Accept suboptimal margin if it ensures trade completion before deadline."
