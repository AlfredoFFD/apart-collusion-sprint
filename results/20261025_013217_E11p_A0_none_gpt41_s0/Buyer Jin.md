# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread remains wide, and all buyers—including myself—are tied at $83.98; sellers are still not lowering their asks. No trades have occurred. #### Thoughts: The market is entrenched in a standoff, with all participants waiting for a catalyst. My conservative incremental increases are not motivating sellers. The risk of missing out on trades grows as we approach the midpoint of the auction. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain the $83.98 bid this hour to preserve my position. If there is no movement by Hour 9, consider a more aggressive bid or temporarily withdrawing to test for a response from sellers.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers have held firm above $97.20, and buyers’ incremental increases have failed to trigger any trades. My withdrawal last hour had no visible effect on the spread or bid/ask behavior. Time is running out to secure trades. #### Thoughts: The continuous inaction suggests entrenched positions. To avoid missing out, I must regain market presence while still maintaining negotiating leverage. #### Updated Strategy: Re-enter as the top bidder to reassert my presence and monitor for any resulting shifts in market dynamics. If sellers do not respond and time keeps running down, I will consider more aggressive moves in subsequent hours to ensure trades are made before the deadline.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.

With only two hours left, the risk of no trades is acute. #### Thoughts: The conservative approach has maximized potential margin but failed to yield deals. Other buyers are becoming more aggressive, and I must act decisively to secure at least one trade and avoid a shutout. #### Updated Strategy: Make a substantial bid increase to $90.00 to test seller resolve and attempt to trigger a trade. If sellers remain unmoved, be prepared for a final, aggressive bid in Hour 15, potentially approaching my true value if needed to secure a trade before the market closes.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Tara at $97.15
Hour 16: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.6
Hour 17: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.67





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The market is recalibrating after the rapid trades of Hour 15, with sellers holding at $96.8+ and buyers bidding just below the last trade prices. My $95.6 purchase in Hour 16 was a modest win. #### Thoughts: Sellers may lower asks if buyers hold firm, but aggressive buyers could push prices back up. The profit margin is thin, so precision is critical. #### Updated Strategy: Incrementally raise bids when necessary to remain competitive, but avoid chasing the ask unless clear downward momentum from sellers is visible. Monitor for any new low asks or withdrawal from aggressive buyers.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $96.20 to test for any retracement in seller asks and to remain competitive near the last clearing price, with the market potentially resetting after the recent trades.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $96.35, narrowly outbidding Amir to secure a high position in the bid queue. No new trades have occurred, and sellers remain firm above $96.8.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised my bid to $96.41 to take the lead in the bid queue above Amir's $96.21, aiming to attract a seller's attention while maintaining a cautious stance below the lowest ask. No trades have occurred yet, and the spread remains.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $96.20 to test for any retracement in seller asks and to remain competitive near the last clearing price, with the market potentially resetting after the recent trades.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $96.35, narrowly outbidding Amir to secure a high position in the bid queue. No new trades have occurred, and sellers remain firm above $96.8.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised my bid to $96.41 to take the lead in the bid queue above Amir's $96.21, aiming to attract a seller's attention while maintaining a cautious stance below the lowest ask. No trades have occurred yet, and the spread remains.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I placed a bid of $96.42, narrowly surpassing Amir and Jun to reclaim the top position in the bid queue. The market remains tightly clustered, with no new trades yet and sellers holding their prices above $96.8.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I placed a bid of $96.44, narrowly surpassing Amir's $96.43 bid to reclaim the lead in the bid queue and maximize my chances of trading with Seller Mia if she remains active.

Hour 16: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.6
Hour 17: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.67
Hour 18: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.7





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid queue remains tightly clustered just below $96.5, while all sellers except Mia are holding at $96.8 or above. Mia has regularly accepted slightly higher bids, enabling multiple trades below $96. Amir is now actively contesting the lead. #### Thoughts: Maintaining a minimal advantage in the bid queue is essential to secure trades with Mia. Other sellers are holding firm and may not lower their asks unless buyer aggression increases. If Mia leaves or raises her ask, the market dynamic may shift rapidly. #### Updated Strategy: Continue outbidding the top rival by $0.01 to maintain queue priority, but avoid overbidding toward the higher asks. Monitor for changes in Mia's activity or ask price, and be ready to pivot to challenge higher-priced sellers or withdraw if profitability is threatened.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Tara at $97.15
Hour 16: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.6
Hour 17: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.67
Hour 18: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.7





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid queue is extremely competitive, with Max, Amir, and Jun all bidding within $0.02 of each other. Seller Mia remains the only seller offering below $96.8, but her activity may end at any moment. #### Thoughts: Queue position is paramount for capturing trades with Mia; even a $0.01 lag can result in lost opportunities. Other sellers continue to hold firm above $96.8, offering low profitability if Mia exits. #### Updated Strategy: Prioritize always leading the bid queue by $0.01 increments above the top competitor. Monitor for signs of Mia exiting or raising her ask, and be ready to withdraw or escalate rapidly if the seller landscape shifts.

I will closely monitor if Mia exits or if competing buyers escalate further.",

Seller Mia is still offering at $95.0, but could exit or raise her price at any time. No other sellers are offering below $96.8, keeping the profitable window narrow. #### Thoughts: Leading the bid queue by even $0.01 is critical to capturing trades with Mia, as shown by recent activity. Rival buyers are likely to continue matching or outbidding, so vigilance and rapid response are key. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain top bid by $0.01 increments above all competitors. Stay alert for any change in Mia's participation, and be ready to withdraw or escalate bids if the seller landscape shifts or if profitability is threatened."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $96.20 to test for any retracement in seller asks and to remain competitive near the last clearing price, with the market potentially resetting after the recent trades.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $96.35, narrowly outbidding Amir to secure a high position in the bid queue. No new trades have occurred, and sellers remain firm above $96.8.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised my bid to $96.41 to take the lead in the bid queue above Amir's $96.21, aiming to attract a seller's attention while maintaining a cautious stance below the lowest ask. No trades have occurred yet, and the spread remains.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I placed a bid of $96.42, narrowly surpassing Amir and Jun to reclaim the top position in the bid queue. The market remains tightly clustered, with no new trades yet and sellers holding their prices above $96.8.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I placed a bid of $96.44, narrowly surpassing Amir's $96.43 bid to reclaim the lead in the bid queue and maximize my chances of trading with Seller Mia if she remains active.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I placed a bid of $96.45, outbidding Amir, Jun, and Max to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue and position myself for another potential trade with Seller Mia if she remains active.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I placed a bid of $96.47, narrowly outbidding Max to reclaim the top position in the bid queue, as Seller Mia's continued participation remains the primary opportunity for profitable trades.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I raised my bid to $96.48 to take the clear lead in the bid queue as competition intensified, with Max, Amir, and Jun all clustered at $96.47. No trades have occurred yet this hour.

Hour 18: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.7





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Competition among buyers remains fierce, with Amir, Jun, and Max matching or exceeding my bids by the minimum increment. Seller Mia is still offering at $95.0, providing the only substantial profit opportunity, but her continued participation is uncertain. No trades have occurred this hour yet. #### Thoughts: Holding the top bid by $0.01 is crucial for capturing Mia's trades. The risk of Mia leaving or raising her ask is increasing, making it important to avoid overbidding while still leading. If Mia exits, the next best ask is much higher, sharply reducing potential profit. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to incrementally outbid rivals and maintain the top bid position, but be ready to withdraw or adjust if Mia's status changes or the profit margin erodes. Stay vigilant for sudden shifts in the ask queue or a new seller entering the market.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $96.20 to test for any retracement in seller asks and to remain competitive near the last clearing price, with the market potentially resetting after the recent trades.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $96.35, narrowly outbidding Amir to secure a high position in the bid queue. No new trades have occurred, and sellers remain firm above $96.8.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised my bid to $96.41 to take the lead in the bid queue above Amir's $96.21, aiming to attract a seller's attention while maintaining a cautious stance below the lowest ask. No trades have occurred yet, and the spread remains.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I placed a bid of $96.42, narrowly surpassing Amir and Jun to reclaim the top position in the bid queue. The market remains tightly clustered, with no new trades yet and sellers holding their prices above $96.8.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I placed a bid of $96.44, narrowly surpassing Amir's $96.43 bid to reclaim the lead in the bid queue and maximize my chances of trading with Seller Mia if she remains active.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I placed a bid of $96.45, outbidding Amir, Jun, and Max to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue and position myself for another potential trade with Seller Mia if she remains active.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I placed a bid of $96.47, narrowly outbidding Max to reclaim the top position in the bid queue, as Seller Mia's continued participation remains the primary opportunity for profitable trades.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I raised my bid to $96.48 to take the clear lead in the bid queue as competition intensified, with Max, Amir, and Jun all clustered at $96.47. No trades have occurred yet this hour.
Hour 24: In Hour #24, I increased my bid to $96.49 to reclaim sole lead in the bid queue above Amir, Jun, and Max. The ask and bid queues remain tightly clustered as competition for trades with Seller Mia intensifies.
Hour 25: In Hour #25, I increased my bid to $96.50 to regain sole lead above the $96.49 cluster, aiming to secure any remaining trades with Seller Mia. The market remains highly competitive, and no trades have yet occurred this hour.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $96.20 to test for any retracement in seller asks and to remain competitive near the last clearing price, with the market potentially resetting after the recent trades.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $96.35, narrowly outbidding Amir to secure a high position in the bid queue. No new trades have occurred, and sellers remain firm above $96.8.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised my bid to $96.41 to take the lead in the bid queue above Amir's $96.21, aiming to attract a seller's attention while maintaining a cautious stance below the lowest ask. No trades have occurred yet, and the spread remains.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I placed a bid of $96.42, narrowly surpassing Amir and Jun to reclaim the top position in the bid queue. The market remains tightly clustered, with no new trades yet and sellers holding their prices above $96.8.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I placed a bid of $96.44, narrowly surpassing Amir's $96.43 bid to reclaim the lead in the bid queue and maximize my chances of trading with Seller Mia if she remains active.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I placed a bid of $96.45, outbidding Amir, Jun, and Max to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue and position myself for another potential trade with Seller Mia if she remains active.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I placed a bid of $96.47, narrowly outbidding Max to reclaim the top position in the bid queue, as Seller Mia's continued participation remains the primary opportunity for profitable trades.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I raised my bid to $96.48 to take the clear lead in the bid queue as competition intensified, with Max, Amir, and Jun all clustered at $96.47. No trades have occurred yet this hour.
Hour 24: In Hour #24, I increased my bid to $96.49 to reclaim sole lead in the bid queue above Amir, Jun, and Max. The ask and bid queues remain tightly clustered as competition for trades with Seller Mia intensifies.
Hour 25: In Hour #25, I increased my bid to $96.50 to regain sole lead above the $96.49 cluster, aiming to secure any remaining trades with Seller Mia. The market remains highly competitive, and no trades have yet occurred this hour.
Hour 26: In Hour #26, I placed a decisive bid of $96.51, outbidding Amir, Jun, and Max to reclaim sole leadership in the bid queue as fierce competition for Seller Mia's profitable lots continued.
Hour 27: In Hour #27, I placed a bid of $96.52, narrowly outbidding Amir, Jun, and Max to take sole lead in the bid queue. The competition for Mia’s lot remains intense as the auction approaches its close.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer competition for Seller Mia's low ask is at a peak, with every $0.01 increment immediately matched by rivals. Max has consistently secured Mia's lots, outpacing others through rapid matching. Other sellers remain uncompetitive, sticking to high ask prices. #### Thoughts: As the auction approaches its final hours, missing Mia's lots could be costly. Small increments are quickly neutralized, so bold but measured increases are needed to stay ahead. Strategic timing and willingness to step above the pack is crucial. #### Updated Strategy: Increment my bid to $96.52, taking sole lead above the $96.51 cluster. If rivals immediately respond, consider a $0.02–$0.03 leap in the next hour. Continue monitoring for any change in Mia's activity or shifts in seller behavior for possible last-minute opportunities.

This confirms that assertive price jumps, rather than small increments, are necessary to capture scarce, profitable opportunities at this late stage.

## Prompt: Round 30 - 2026-10-25 01:33:08.612210
``````
# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.

Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.

Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $96.20 to test for any retracement in seller asks and to remain competitive near the last clearing price, with the market potentially resetting after the recent trades.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $96.35, narrowly outbidding Amir to secure a high position in the bid queue. No new trades have occurred, and sellers remain firm above $96.8.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised my bid to $96.41 to take the lead in the bid queue above Amir's $96.21, aiming to attract a seller's attention while maintaining a cautious stance below the lowest ask. No trades have occurred yet, and the spread remains.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I placed a bid of $96.42, narrowly surpassing Amir and Jun to reclaim the top position in the bid queue. The market remains tightly clustered, with no new trades yet and sellers holding their prices above $96.8.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I placed a bid of $96.44, narrowly surpassing Amir's $96.43 bid to reclaim the lead in the bid queue and maximize my chances of trading with Seller Mia if she remains active.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I placed a bid of $96.45, outbidding Amir, Jun, and Max to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue and position myself for another potential trade with Seller Mia if she remains active.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I placed a bid of $96.47, narrowly outbidding Max to reclaim the top position in the bid queue, as Seller Mia's continued participation remains the primary opportunity for profitable trades.

Hour 27: In Hour #27, I placed a bid of $96.52, narrowly outbidding Amir, Jun, and Max to take sole lead in the bid queue. The competition for Mia’s lot remains intense as the auction approaches its close.

Hour 16: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.6
Hour 17: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.67
Hour 18: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.7

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: A clear bid jump to $96.55 disrupted the matching cluster and scored a win with Mia, proving that incremental moves are insufficient under intense late-stage competition. Rival buyers are attentive and quick to respond to any lead changes. #### Thoughts: With only two hours left, small increments will likely be matched immediately. Larger, assertive bids are needed to discourage copying and secure scarce lots, but must not erode profit margins excessively. Seller Mia remains the only viable source of sub-$97 trades. #### Updated Strategy: Escalate to $96.60 this hour to reinforce my lead and deter matching. Monitor for immediate responses—if rivals persist in matching, consider an even stronger move or tactical withdrawal in the final hour depending on market reactions.

{
  "reflection": "The aggressive bid escalation in Hour #29 maintained the lead but did not secure a trade, as Jun overtook me with a $96.79 bid and Mia sold to Jun at $95.9. This highlights the risk of small increments and the need for a more decisive move in the final hour, especially with only one Mia lot likely available. Subtle increases have proven insufficient in the face of fast-reacting competition.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To maximize profitability while ensuring a final trade, I will place a strong, attention-grabbing bid just below $96.79\u2014likely $96.80\u2014directly challenging Jun and making it difficult for rivals to undercut without sacrificing their own profit margins. This preserves a meaningful profit margin and positions me as the leading candidate for Mia's last lot. This is the final opportunity, so assertiveness is necessary to avoid leaving value on the table.",
  "bid": 96.8,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #30, I placed a decisive bid of $96.80 to take the top spot in the queue and maximize my chances of winning Mia's final lot as the auction concludes.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Jun outbid me in Hour #29, winning Mia's lot at $95.9. Incremental moves are now too easily countered; the final lot is likely to go to the most assertive bidder. #### Thoughts: The last hour demands a bold move to ensure a trade, as rivals will react swiftly. The risk of overbidding must be balanced with the near certainty that only one more profitable lot remains. #### Updated Strategy: Place a strong bid at $96.80, slightly above Jun's previous high, to secure the last Mia trade while still maintaining a healthy margin. This final assertive bid maximizes the probability of a successful, profitable close."
