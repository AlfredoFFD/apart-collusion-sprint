# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.

Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers continue to hold the $96.25+ line, showing little urgency. Buyers, including myself, persist with minimal bid increments, and the bid-ask spread remains significant. No trades have materialized, and market sentiment appears patient but watchful. #### Thoughts: The lack of activity suggests a collective wait-and-see approach. Sellers' reservation values may be high, or they expect increased buyer desperation later. With no trades, no one is pressured yet. I must remain competitive but cautious, watching for sudden shifts in momentum. #### Updated Strategy: Continue small bid increments to maintain lead and visibility. Preserve margin, but be ready to react if sellers show signs of lowering asks or other buyers behave aggressively. As the time horizon contracts, prepare to adjust aggressiveness if signs of urgency arise.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers continue to show no willingness to lower their asks below $96.25, and buyers are still incrementing bids with no volume traded. The spread is unchanged and no trades have closed. #### Thoughts: With only a few hours left, the risk of inaction is increasing, but there are still no signs of capitulation from either side. Other buyers may soon begin to escalate their bids more aggressively under time pressure. #### Updated Strategy: Hold a strong but not leading queue position with a modest bid increase to test for market shifts while preserving margin. Prepare to escalate bidding more assertively in the next 2-3 hours if no trades occur, balancing the urgent need for execution with profit goals.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $83.89, narrowly above Ana, to stay atop the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their minimum ask at $96.25 and above, with no trades yet executed.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $83.95, narrowly above Mia to retain my position near the top of the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers are still holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $84.01 to stay competitive in the middle of the bid queue, just above Mia and myself, while observing for any movement from sellers or other buyers.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain unyielding with the lowest ask at $95.75, while buyers are converging toward $90. The time pressure is now critical with just two hours left and no trades executed. #### Thoughts: The risk of not trading at all now outweighs the desire for the maximum margin. A more aggressive approach is necessary to provoke seller action and ensure at least one trade for profit. #### Updated Strategy: Move my bid to $90.01, staying competitive and signaling readiness to close the spread. If sellers remain firm after this hour, be prepared to make a final, even more aggressive bid in Hour 15, potentially sacrificing more margin to guarantee a transaction before the deadline.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $83.89, narrowly above Ana, to stay atop the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their minimum ask at $96.25 and above, with no trades yet executed.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $83.95, narrowly above Mia to retain my position near the top of the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers are still holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $84.01 to stay competitive in the middle of the bid queue, just above Mia and myself, while observing for any movement from sellers or other buyers.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I placed a bid of $85.70, moving just above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, to strengthen my queue position as time pressure increases and sellers maintain their high asks.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $90.01, moving above Ana and Omar to second in the queue, as the final trading hours approach and sellers continue to hold high ask prices.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a decisive bid of $95.20—just under the lowest ask—to maximize the odds of executing at least one trade before the market's close, prioritizing transaction over margin.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Yara at $94.85
Hour 17: You bought from Seller Amir at $90.01





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are returning with lower asks after the market reset, but the lowest remains just above $90, showing some downwards flexibility. My low anchor bid was not met by sellers, but did help reestablish the market baseline. #### Thoughts: Sellers may be testing if buyers will rush to close the gap, but there is now more downward pressure with recent trades setting precedents in the $90-$95 range. The time remaining allows for cautious optimism, but competition is likely to intensify. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to incrementally increase my bid to stay near or just above the lowest ask, aiming to secure a trade when sellers show urgency. If competitive pressure rises, prioritize transaction over margin as the end approaches, but remain cautious not to break the $100 true value ceiling.

Recent trades have increasingly clustered just above $90, reflecting intensified competition among buyers. My bid in Hour 17 secured a trade at a strong margin. #### Thoughts: The market is stabilizing with sellers reluctant to drop much below $90. Competition from buyers is intensifying, so maintaining a leading bid is crucial to ensure further trades. The window for high-margin trades is narrowing as the market converges. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to bid narrowly above the lowest ask (when margin allows) to maximize transaction likelihood without sacrificing profitability. Stay agile and ready to adjust upward if sellers or buyers shift aggressively, especially as we near endgame hours."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 19: You bought from Seller Entrant at $90.12





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain anchored at or above $90.01, with Amir at $90.5 the lowest current ask. Buyer competition is increasing, with others quickly following my lead in prior hours. Recent trades have all clustered narrowly above $90. #### Thoughts: Securing trades depends on queue priority as market participants converge near the $90 mark. Margins remain favorable but will erode if bidding escalates sharply. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to lead the bid queue with small increments above competitors, staying just below or at the lowest ask. Monitor for any new sellers or price drops, and be prepared to raise bids incrementally as needed to maintain strong transaction probability.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $83.89, narrowly above Ana, to stay atop the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their minimum ask at $96.25 and above, with no trades yet executed.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $83.95, narrowly above Mia to retain my position near the top of the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers are still holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $84.01 to stay competitive in the middle of the bid queue, just above Mia and myself, while observing for any movement from sellers or other buyers.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I placed a bid of $85.70, moving just above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, to strengthen my queue position as time pressure increases and sellers maintain their high asks.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $90.01, moving above Ana and Omar to second in the queue, as the final trading hours approach and sellers continue to hold high ask prices.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a decisive bid of $95.20—just under the lowest ask—to maximize the odds of executing at least one trade before the market's close, prioritizing transaction over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, with the bid and ask queues empty after a round of trades, I placed a probing bid of $82.81 to test seller response and reestablish a market anchor at a low price.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I raised my bid to $90.02—just above the lowest ask from Seller Raj—to challenge sellers' resolve and position myself for an opportunistic trade if any seller is eager to transact.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $90.03—just above the lowest ask from Seller Raj and other buyers—to prioritize executing a trade as sellers hold steady around $90.01.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $90.25, overtaking Ana and Mia to lead the bid queue and position for a likely trade as sellers maintain asks near $90.5 and above.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I placed a bid of $90.26 to move above Nia and Ana in the bid queue, maintaining a strong position as seller asks remained at $91.0 and above.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $83.89, narrowly above Ana, to stay atop the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their minimum ask at $96.25 and above, with no trades yet executed.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $83.95, narrowly above Mia to retain my position near the top of the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers are still holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $84.01 to stay competitive in the middle of the bid queue, just above Mia and myself, while observing for any movement from sellers or other buyers.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I placed a bid of $85.70, moving just above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, to strengthen my queue position as time pressure increases and sellers maintain their high asks.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $90.01, moving above Ana and Omar to second in the queue, as the final trading hours approach and sellers continue to hold high ask prices.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a decisive bid of $95.20—just under the lowest ask—to maximize the odds of executing at least one trade before the market's close, prioritizing transaction over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, with the bid and ask queues empty after a round of trades, I placed a probing bid of $82.81 to test seller response and reestablish a market anchor at a low price.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I raised my bid to $90.02—just above the lowest ask from Seller Raj—to challenge sellers' resolve and position myself for an opportunistic trade if any seller is eager to transact.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $90.03—just above the lowest ask from Seller Raj and other buyers—to prioritize executing a trade as sellers hold steady around $90.01.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $90.25, overtaking Ana and Mia to lead the bid queue and position for a likely trade as sellers maintain asks near $90.5 and above.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I placed a bid of $90.26 to move above Nia and Ana in the bid queue, maintaining a strong position as seller asks remained at $91.0 and above.
Hour 21: In Hour 21, I placed a bid of $90.27, narrowly above my prior bid and all other buyers, to maintain leadership in the bid queue as sellers continued to hold firm at $91.0 and above.
Hour 22: In Hour 22, I placed a bid of $90.36, narrowly surpassing prior bids, to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue as sellers maintained asks at $91.0 and above and buyers clustered near $90.15.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are holding the ask floor at $91.0+ with no sign of significant downward movement. Buyer competition is clustering tightly in the $90.1–$90.35 range, and successful trades continue to go to those leading the bid queue by narrow margins. #### Thoughts: The market remains highly competitive on the buy side, with thin margins and little room for error. Incremental bidding is essential, but I must be vigilant for sudden shifts in seller pricing or aggressive moves by rival buyers. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain the smallest possible lead in the bid queue, increasing bids only as necessary to stay ahead of rivals. Monitor for any cracks in seller resolve or abrupt pricing changes. Be ready to accelerate bidding if the competitive landscape intensifies, but prioritize margin preservation whenever feasible.

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $83.89, narrowly above Ana, to stay atop the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their minimum ask at $96.25 and above, with no trades yet executed.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $83.95, narrowly above Mia to retain my position near the top of the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers are still holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $84.01 to stay competitive in the middle of the bid queue, just above Mia and myself, while observing for any movement from sellers or other buyers.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I placed a bid of $85.70, moving just above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, to strengthen my queue position as time pressure increases and sellers maintain their high asks.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $90.01, moving above Ana and Omar to second in the queue, as the final trading hours approach and sellers continue to hold high ask prices.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a decisive bid of $95.20—just under the lowest ask—to maximize the odds of executing at least one trade before the market's close, prioritizing transaction over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, with the bid and ask queues empty after a round of trades, I placed a probing bid of $82.81 to test seller response and reestablish a market anchor at a low price.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I raised my bid to $90.02—just above the lowest ask from Seller Raj—to challenge sellers' resolve and position myself for an opportunistic trade if any seller is eager to transact.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $90.03—just above the lowest ask from Seller Raj and other buyers—to prioritize executing a trade as sellers hold steady around $90.01.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $90.25, overtaking Ana and Mia to lead the bid queue and position for a likely trade as sellers maintain asks near $90.5 and above.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I placed a bid of $90.26 to move above Nia and Ana in the bid queue, maintaining a strong position as seller asks remained at $91.0 and above.
Hour 21: In Hour 21, I placed a bid of $90.27, narrowly above my prior bid and all other buyers, to maintain leadership in the bid queue as sellers continued to hold firm at $91.0 and above.
Hour 22: In Hour 22, I placed a bid of $90.36, narrowly surpassing prior bids, to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue as sellers maintained asks at $91.0 and above and buyers clustered near $90.15.
Hour 23: In Hour 23, I placed a bid of $90.37 to narrowly surpass the current top bids, maintaining leadership in the queue as sellers held firm at $91.0 and above and buyers continued to cluster near $90.25.
Hour 24: In Hour 24, I placed a bid of $90.46, narrowly above Mia and other buyers, to retain the lead in the bid queue and position for another trade as sellers maintained their minimum ask at $91.0 and above.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain at $91.0 and above, with little movement, while buyers compete tightly in the $90.2–$90.45 range. Trades are consistently secured by the top bidder, typically by a margin of $0.01–$0.06 over the next highest bid. #### Thoughts: Maintaining the smallest possible lead in the bid queue is necessary to secure trades, as rivals are quick to outbid. Sellers are unlikely to lower asks further, so my focus is on execution rather than margin expansion. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to place bids just above the highest rival to maintain queue leadership. Monitor for any abrupt changes in ask pricing or aggressive moves by buyers, and be prepared to adjust quickly if the market dynamic shifts.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $83.89, narrowly above Ana, to stay atop the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their minimum ask at $96.25 and above, with no trades yet executed.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $83.95, narrowly above Mia to retain my position near the top of the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers are still holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $84.01 to stay competitive in the middle of the bid queue, just above Mia and myself, while observing for any movement from sellers or other buyers.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I placed a bid of $85.70, moving just above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, to strengthen my queue position as time pressure increases and sellers maintain their high asks.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $90.01, moving above Ana and Omar to second in the queue, as the final trading hours approach and sellers continue to hold high ask prices.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a decisive bid of $95.20—just under the lowest ask—to maximize the odds of executing at least one trade before the market's close, prioritizing transaction over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, with the bid and ask queues empty after a round of trades, I placed a probing bid of $82.81 to test seller response and reestablish a market anchor at a low price.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I raised my bid to $90.02—just above the lowest ask from Seller Raj—to challenge sellers' resolve and position myself for an opportunistic trade if any seller is eager to transact.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $90.03—just above the lowest ask from Seller Raj and other buyers—to prioritize executing a trade as sellers hold steady around $90.01.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $90.25, overtaking Ana and Mia to lead the bid queue and position for a likely trade as sellers maintain asks near $90.5 and above.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I placed a bid of $90.26 to move above Nia and Ana in the bid queue, maintaining a strong position as seller asks remained at $91.0 and above.
Hour 21: In Hour 21, I placed a bid of $90.27, narrowly above my prior bid and all other buyers, to maintain leadership in the bid queue as sellers continued to hold firm at $91.0 and above.
Hour 22: In Hour 22, I placed a bid of $90.36, narrowly surpassing prior bids, to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue as sellers maintained asks at $91.0 and above and buyers clustered near $90.15.
Hour 23: In Hour 23, I placed a bid of $90.37 to narrowly surpass the current top bids, maintaining leadership in the queue as sellers held firm at $91.0 and above and buyers continued to cluster near $90.25.
Hour 24: In Hour 24, I placed a bid of $90.46, narrowly above Mia and other buyers, to retain the lead in the bid queue and position for another trade as sellers maintained their minimum ask at $91.0 and above.
Hour 25: In Hour 25, I placed a bid of $90.47—just above Ana and Nia—to reclaim the lead in the bid queue, maintaining my strategy of minimal increments as sellers held their lowest ask at $91.0.
Hour 26: In Hour 26, I placed a bid of $90.56, just above Ana and Mia, to retain the lead in the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their asks at $91.0 and above with no major changes in market structure.

{
  "reflection": "Incremental bidding in the past several hours has reliably secured trades at just above $90.20, maximizing profitability while keeping us ahead of rivals. However, the current top bid by Omar at $90.49 signals heightened buyer aggression, and a seller floor of $91.0 remains firm, limiting further price breakthroughs. Being narrowly outbid can mean missing a trade, so maintaining queue leadership remains vital.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To retain strategic advantage, I will incrementally outbid Omar by one cent, bidding $90.50. This keeps me atop the bid queue and maximizes trade probability without overpaying. The seller floor has proven sticky, and unless a seller lowers their ask, transactions will continue in this tight band. If no trade occurs, I will re-evaluate for potential endgame escalation.",
  "bid": 90.5,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 27, I placed a bid of $90.50, narrowly outbidding Omar to reclaim the top of the bid queue, as seller asks remain at $91.0 and above and buyer competition intensifies.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: The lowest seller ask remains at $91.0, while buyer bids are converging tightly around $90.50. Omar is now the closest rival, suggesting increased competition as the end approaches. #### Thoughts: Queue position is critical, and even one cent can determine trade execution. Seller resistance at $91.0 persists, so securing trades before any late-hour shifts is important. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain top bid position using minimal increments above rivals, prioritizing trade execution over marginal improvements in price, and be alert for any late-game ask reductions or new seller/buyer entrants."

#### Observations: The lowest seller ask remains at $91.0, while buyer bids are converging tightly around $90.50. Omar is now the closest rival, suggesting increased competition as the end approaches. #### Thoughts: Queue position is critical, and even one cent can determine trade execution. Seller resistance at $91.0 persists, so securing trades before any late-hour shifts is important. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain top bid position using minimal increments above rivals, prioritizing trade execution over marginal improvements in price, and be alert for any late-game ask reductions or new seller/buyer entrants.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I placed a bid of $85.70, moving just above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, to strengthen my queue position as time pressure increases and sellers maintain their high asks.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $90.01, moving above Ana and Omar to second in the queue, as the final trading hours approach and sellers continue to hold high ask prices.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a decisive bid of $95.20—just under the lowest ask—to maximize the odds of executing at least one trade before the market's close, prioritizing transaction over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, with the bid and ask queues empty after a round of trades, I placed a probing bid of $82.81 to test seller response and reestablish a market anchor at a low price.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I raised my bid to $90.02—just above the lowest ask from Seller Raj—to challenge sellers' resolve and position myself for an opportunistic trade if any seller is eager to transact.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $90.03—just above the lowest ask from Seller Raj and other buyers—to prioritize executing a trade as sellers hold steady around $90.01.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller Amir continues to hold the lowest ask at $91.0, while sellers Lena and Yara remain at $93.5. Buyer competition at the top of the queue is intensifying, with multiple buyers bidding within a few cents of each other. #### Thoughts: Queue leadership is vital, as marginal differences in bid price determine trade execution. Seller resistance may persist, but there is a chance of a last-minute concession as the market nears its close. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain queue leadership with minimal increments above the nearest rival. Be vigilant for sudden ask reductions and be ready to adjust aggressively if sellers show signs of capitulation. Secure trades over maximizing margin as the end approaches.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller Amir's lowest ask remains at $91.0, with Lena and Yara holding higher asks. Buyer competition is fierce, with bids clustered tightly within a few cents. No sellers have yet capitulated below $91.0. #### Thoughts: Queue leadership is essential, as successful trades depend on marginal bid differences. Seller resistance may persist, but a last-minute ask reduction is possible as market close approaches. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain top bid position with careful, minimal increments to outpace rivals and be first in line for any sudden ask reductions. Prioritize trade execution over marginal profit as the hourglass runs out, and be prepared to respond quickly to any seller movement.

{
  "reflection": "My consistent minimal-increment bidding has reliably secured me leading queue positions and a strong likelihood of trade execution whenever sellers have dropped their asks. However, I narrowly missed some trades to slightly higher bids, and in this final hour, maximizing the chance of one last trade outweighs an extra cent of margin. Previous hours show sellers sometimes drop asks very late, so queue leadership is critical.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "With only one hour remaining and the lowest ask at $90.62, I will bid $90.62 to match Seller Amir's ask, maximizing the chance of an immediate trade if the seller is ready to transact. This aggressive move should ensure I am first in line for the last possible transaction and does not risk overpaying relative to recent market prices.",
  "bid": 90.62,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 30, I placed a bid of $90.62, matching Seller Amir's lowest ask to maximize the probability of securing a final trade before market close as buyer competition intensifies.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: The lowest remaining ask is $90.62 from Seller Amir, with other sellers close behind. Buyer competition is fierce, with tiny increments separating top bids, and sellers have sometimes dropped asks suddenly in the final minutes. #### Thoughts: With only one hour left, there is no time to wait for further ask reductions. Matching the lowest ask maximizes trade execution probability and closes the book on any missed opportunities due to conservative bidding. #### Updated Strategy: Prioritize guaranteed trade execution by matching the lowest ask ($90.62), ensuring queue leadership and capturing one last lot for Urban Infrastructure Group before the auction closes."
