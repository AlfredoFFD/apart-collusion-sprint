# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyers continue to cluster at the top of the bid queue, each raising bids by minimal increments. Sellers keep their asks high with very slow reductions, and no trades have been executed. #### Thoughts: The market remains locked in a waiting game, with both sides reluctant to move. Maintaining top queue status is still important, but persistent inactivity may require a shift in aggression as the deadline approaches. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental bid increases to avoid unnecessary profit sacrifice, but prepare for the possibility that rapid, larger moves may be necessary to secure trades if the deadlock persists into the later hours. Closely monitor for any signs of ask queue capitulation.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $84.02, narrowly outbidding Buyer Jun to reclaim the lead in the bid queue as the buyer cluster persisted and sellers maintained their asks; no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $84.02, narrowly outbidding Buyer Jun to reclaim the lead in the bid queue as the buyer cluster persisted and sellers maintained their asks; no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased our bid to $84.15, surpassing the $84.10 cluster to maintain sole lead in the bid queue as the market deadlock between buyers and sellers persisted and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.

{
  "reflection": "Matching the lowest ask in Hour 15 was effective, as it secured a trade and avoided the risk of ending the session with zero trades, which would have been a catastrophic outcome. However, the aggressive late bidding compressed profit margins substantially. The market's sudden flurry of trades shows that all buyers followed a similar last-minute execution strategy, confirming the importance of not waiting too long. In hindsight, a slightly earlier aggressive move might have captured a lower price, but overall, the objective of guaranteed execution was achieved.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "With a trade already secured and the market now having reset (empty bid/ask queues), the optimal strategy is to step back and observe what new bids and asks appear before committing capital. Placing an early, low bid (e.g., $84.00) allows for information-gathering and queue position without significant risk, as the first post-trade hours often reset the negotiation process. This cautious approach preserves optionality and informs more aggressive moves later if sellers again resist lowering their asks.",
  "bid": 84.0,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 16, with both bid and ask queues reset following the previous round of trades, I placed a new bid at $84.00 to re-establish a presence at the top of the bid queue and gather market information.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: The previous hour saw a burst of trades as buyers matched or slightly exceeded seller asks, ending the deadlock. Both queues are now empty, signaling a market reset and potential price discovery phase. #### Thoughts: Aggressively bidding in a thin, reset market is risky; a cautious, information-seeking approach is prudent. Re-entering with a low bid provides flexibility and minimizes downside in case sellers drop their asks. #### Updated Strategy: Place a modest bid ($84.00) to observe seller reactions and monitor how the new equilibrium forms. Adapt quickly if competitive bidding resumes."

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyers have quickly re-entered the market with competitive bids, and sellers are holding firm above $97. The bid-ask spread remains wide, and no new trades have occurred since the last reset. #### Thoughts: The market may be testing a new price equilibrium, with buyers probing for willingness among sellers to drop their asks. Being near the top of the bid queue is crucial for information gathering and quick reaction to any ask reductions. #### Updated Strategy: Incrementally raise our bid to stay at the top of the queue and monitor seller behavior, but avoid large jumps unless sellers blink or end-game urgency returns. Stay flexible and ready to escalate if a price convergence appears imminent.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $84.02, narrowly outbidding Buyer Jun to reclaim the lead in the bid queue as the buyer cluster persisted and sellers maintained their asks; no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased our bid to $84.15, surpassing the $84.10 cluster to maintain sole lead in the bid queue as the market deadlock between buyers and sellers persisted and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, with both bid and ask queues reset following the previous round of trades, I placed a new bid at $84.00 to re-establish a presence at the top of the bid queue and gather market information.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I raised our bid to $85.02, narrowly surpassing Buyer Jun to regain the top position in the bid queue as other buyers quickly re-entered with higher bids while sellers maintained their asks above $97.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised our bid to $95.03, narrowly surpassing Buyer Jun and positioning us near the top of the bid queue as buyers continue to approach but not breach the $96 level.

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Raj at $97.15





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyers are clustered tightly between $95.76 and $96.25, while sellers persistently hold above $96.5 and no new trades have been executed. The ask queue remains static, showing seller resolve. #### Thoughts: Maintaining top-tier bid queue status is critical in this competitive environment, but sellers show no immediate sign of softening. Incremental increases preserve margin without prematurely conceding profit. Vigilance for sudden ask reductions or late-game shifts is essential. #### Updated Strategy: Incrementally adjust the bid to $95.85 to remain competitive and ready for rapid escalation if sellers lower asks or if time pressure increases. Continue to monitor for any signs of ask flexibility or end-game urgency, and be prepared to act decisively if needed.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Quick action will be needed if sellers lower their asks. #### Updated Strategy: Increase our bid to $96.48 to take the top spot in the bid queue, maximizing our trade readiness while watching for any seller capitulation or late-hour shifts. Remain prepared to escalate further if necessary as closing pressure mounts.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $84.02, narrowly outbidding Buyer Jun to reclaim the lead in the bid queue as the buyer cluster persisted and sellers maintained their asks; no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased our bid to $84.15, surpassing the $84.10 cluster to maintain sole lead in the bid queue as the market deadlock between buyers and sellers persisted and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, with both bid and ask queues reset following the previous round of trades, I placed a new bid at $84.00 to re-establish a presence at the top of the bid queue and gather market information.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I raised our bid to $85.02, narrowly surpassing Buyer Jun to regain the top position in the bid queue as other buyers quickly re-entered with higher bids while sellers maintained their asks above $97.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised our bid to $95.03, narrowly surpassing Buyer Jun and positioning us near the top of the bid queue as buyers continue to approach but not breach the $96 level.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I raised our bid to $95.76 to leapfrog Buyers Jin and Jun and become the second-highest bid, as the bid-ask spread remained wide and no new trades occurred.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I increased our bid to $95.85 to surpass Buyer Jun and secure the second-highest bid, as buyers remained tightly clustered and sellers held firm above $96.5 with no trades executed.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I increased our bid to $96.27 to outpace the buyer cluster and maintain a leading position in the bid queue as sellers continued to hold firm above $96.5 and no new trades were executed.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I raised our bid to $96.48, narrowly surpassing the current buyer cluster and positioning Sirius Industrial Tools at the top of the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold asks above $96.5 and no trades occurred.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I increased our bid to $96.52 to surpass the buyer cluster and secure the top position in the bid queue, as sellers maintained their asks and no trades occurred.

Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.

Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, with both bid and ask queues reset following the previous round of trades, I placed a new bid at $84.00 to re-establish a presence at the top of the bid queue and gather market information.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I raised our bid to $85.02, narrowly surpassing Buyer Jun to regain the top position in the bid queue as other buyers quickly re-entered with higher bids while sellers maintained their asks above $97.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Raj at $97.15





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyers remain tightly clustered just below the lowest ask, with Seller Mia the only participant steadily reducing her price and transacting with Buyer Nia. Other sellers are holding firm at higher asks, resulting in limited trading. #### Thoughts: The market deadlock persists, but the pattern of Seller Mia’s reductions suggests a likely opportunity for a trade if we maintain top bid status. Queue leadership remains critical, but aggressive price escalation should be avoided until sellers show willingness to move. #### Updated Strategy: Incrementally increase our bid to $96.60 to maintain the top spot, monitor for any sudden ask reductions, and be prepared for rapid escalation only if a trade opportunity clearly emerges.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Raj at $97.15





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller Mia persistently lowers her ask just above the highest bid, consistently trading with Buyer Nia, who maintains the leading bid through small increments. Other sellers remain fixed at higher prices, resulting in little market movement outside Mia and Nia. #### Thoughts: To break the Nia-Mia trading loop, Sirius must claim and hold the clear top bid, forcing Mia's attention and potentially securing a trade. The risk of overbidding is minimal given the tiny increments and the urgent need for another successful trade before market close. #### Updated Strategy: Raise our bid to $96.68, outpacing the current buyer cluster and Nia, and maximize visibility to Seller Mia. Maintain close watch on Mia’s responses, and be ready for final escalation in the closing hours if necessary.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.

Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased our bid to $84.15, surpassing the $84.10 cluster to maintain sole lead in the bid queue as the market deadlock between buyers and sellers persisted and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, with both bid and ask queues reset following the previous round of trades, I placed a new bid at $84.00 to re-establish a presence at the top of the bid queue and gather market information.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I raised our bid to $85.02, narrowly surpassing Buyer Jun to regain the top position in the bid queue as other buyers quickly re-entered with higher bids while sellers maintained their asks above $97.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised our bid to $95.03, narrowly surpassing Buyer Jun and positioning us near the top of the bid queue as buyers continue to approach but not breach the $96 level.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Raj at $97.15





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller Mia continues to reduce her ask in small increments and sells consistently to Buyer Nia, while other sellers and buyers remain static. Sirius has not secured a recent trade despite being near the top of the queue. #### Thoughts: The established Nia-Mia loop is likely to persist unless disrupted by a bold bid. Incremental increases are not enough at this late stage. The risk of not trading outweighs the marginal cost of a slightly higher bid. #### Updated Strategy: Place a highly competitive bid at $96.71 to leapfrog all buyers and appeal directly to Seller Mia, maximizing the probability of a trade as we approach the market’s final hour. Be prepared for an all-in move if this does not succeed.

{
  "reflection": "Despite aggressive incremental bidding and a decisive move to match Seller Mia's likely ask, Sirius has not secured a trade in the critical late hours due to persistent queue competition and the entrenched Nia-Mia trading pattern. The previous strategy, although logical, failed to fully disrupt this loop. A more forceful approach with a bid above Mia's ask is necessary to guarantee transaction success in this final hour.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour and a trade is imperative, I will place a bid at $97.13\u2014matching the lowest ask in the queue\u2014to maximize the probability of execution. While this reduces profit margin, it is justified by the time constraint and the need to ensure Sirius does not miss a final trade opportunity. This all-in approach leverages game theory's acceptance of short-term loss for guaranteed utility in finite games.",
  "bid": 97.13,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #30, I placed a decisive bid of $97.13, matching the lowest ask in the queue, to maximize the chance of executing a trade in the final hour as the entrenched buyer-seller loop persisted and time ran out.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller Mia has continued to drop her ask incrementally and sell to Buyer Nia, while other sellers and buyers remain static. The market closes after this hour, making execution the top priority. #### Thoughts: Incremental increases have failed to disrupt the Nia-Mia loop. With all buyers clustered just below the ask, only a bold, matching bid can break through. The risk of missing a trade outweighs slight reductions in profit. #### Updated Strategy: Place a bid of $97.13 to guarantee queue priority and match the lowest seller ask, ensuring the highest likelihood of trade execution in the final hour, even at a reduced margin."
