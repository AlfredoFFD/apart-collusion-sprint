This allows me to maximize profit while remaining competitive in the market. Future bids will be adjusted based on market movements and trade outcomes.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start with Hour #1. The user is Buyer Nia, part of Solaris Energy, trying to maximize profit in a continuous double auction for heavy metals. The true value per lot is $100. The market has just opened with the given bids and asks. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the current Bid and Ask queues. The Bid Queue has three entries: 82.08 (Ana), 82.3 (Omar), and 82.34 (Nia). The Ask Queue has Lena at 97.62, Kit at 97.34, and Mia at 96.31. So, the highest bid is 82.34 from Nia, and the lowest ask is 96.31 from Mia. \n\nSince Nia is already in the Bid Queue with 82.34, but the asks are all higher than that. So there's a big spread between the highest bid and the lowest ask. The current bid is 82.34, but the asks are all above that. That means no trades have happened yet because the highest bid is lower than the lowest ask. \n\nThe true value is $100, so Nia can afford to bid up to that. However, since the market is a continuous double auction, placing a higher bid might help in getting matched with the asks. But if there's a big spread, maybe there's a chance to increase the bid to meet the asks. However, the problem is that if Nia bids higher than the existing bids, she might not get a trade unless someone else's ask is matched. \n\nWait, but the current bid is 82.34. The asks are all higher than that. So to make a trade, Nia would need to have a bid that's higher than the lowest ask. But the lowest ask is 96.31. So if Nia bids, say, 96.31, she could potentially match with Mia's ask. But that would be a very low profit margin. The true value is $100, so if she buys at 96.31, the profit per lot would be $3.69. But maybe she can wait for higher bids from others? \n\nAlternatively, if she increases her bid, maybe she can push the price up. However, since the market is a double auction, the bid queue is sorted, and the highest bid is at the front. But in this case, the highest bid is 82.34, and the asks are all higher. So unless another buyer increases their bid, there's no trade. \n\nBut since Nia is the only buyer here, maybe she needs to place a bid that can meet the asks. However, the existing asks are all higher than her current bid. So if she wants to make a trade, she must raise her bid to at least the lowest ask, which is 96.31. But that's a significant jump. Alternatively, maybe she can wait and see if other buyers increase their bids, but since she's the only one acting here, she might need to take the initiative. \n\nBut if she bids 96.31, she could match with Mia's ask. However, that's a very low profit. Since the true value is $100, maybe she can afford to bid higher. For example, if she bids 97.34, which is the next ask from Kit. But then, if she bids 97.34, she could match with Kit's ask. But that's still a profit of $2.66. \n\nAlternatively, if she bids 97.62, which is Lena's ask. But that would give a profit of $2.38. \n\nBut this seems like a very low margin. However, since the true value is $100, maybe she can set a bid that's a bit lower than $100, but still higher than the existing asks. For example, if she bids $98, then she can match with Mia's ask at 96.31, but that's not possible. Wait, no. If she bids $98, then the lowest ask is 96.31. So, her bid would be higher than the ask, so a trade would occur. \n\nWait, in a double auction, a bid is a price you're willing to pay, and an ask is the price you're willing to sell. So if a bid is higher than an ask, a trade happens. So if Nia bids 96.31, that's equal to Mia's ask. So if the bid is equal to the ask, they can trade. But since the bid is a price you're willing to pay, and the ask is the price you're willing to sell. So, in that case, the trade would occur at the ask price. Wait, no. In a typical auction, the highest bid meets the lowest ask. So if Nia bids 96.31, that would be the same as the lowest ask. So the trade would happen at 96.31, and Nia would have a profit of $3.69. \n\nBut maybe she can bid higher than the ask. For example, if she bids 97.00, which is higher than the lowest ask of 96.31. Then the trade would happen at 96.31, but she's willing to pay more. However, the actual trade price would be the ask price, not the bid. So maybe she can just bid the same as the ask to get the trade. \n\nBut the problem is that if she bids higher than the ask, she might not get a better price. So, the optimal strategy here is to bid just enough to get the trade, which is the same as the ask price. \n\nBut given that the true value is $100, and the asks are all below that, she can afford to buy at the ask prices and still make a profit. \n\nIn this case, the lowest ask is 96.31. If she bids 96.31, she can match with that. But since she's a buyer, she can't set the price higher than the ask. Wait, no. In a double auction, the buyer's bid is the maximum they're willing to pay. The seller's ask is the minimum they'll accept. So if a buyer's bid is higher than a seller's ask, a trade happens at the seller's ask price. \n\nTherefore, to get a trade, she needs to have a bid that is higher than or equal to the lowest ask. So, in this case, the lowest ask is 96.31. If she bids 96.31, that's equal to the ask. So the trade would happen. But if she bids higher than that, say 97.00, then the trade would still happen at 96.31, but she's willing to pay more. However, in that case, the trade is still made at the lower price. \n\nSo, the best strategy would be to bid the same as the lowest ask, which is 96.31. That way, she can get the trade at that price. However, since the true value is $100, that's a profit of $3.69 per lot. \n\nBut wait, looking at the current Bid Queue, Nia is already in the queue with 82.34. So she might need to replace her bid with a higher one. \n\nSo, the plan for this hour is to replace her current bid (82.34) with a higher bid that can meet the ask. The minimal necessary is 96.31, but she can bid higher if she wants. However, since the true value is $100, maybe she can afford to bid up to that. Let me check the profit. \n\nIf she buys at 96.31, profit is $100 - $96.31 = $3.69. If she bids $97.34 (the next ask from Kit), then if that gets matched, the profit would be $100 - $97.34 = $2.66. But that's worse. So the best is to get the lowest possible ask. \n\nSo the optimal bid is 96.31. But since the asks are in the queue, she can only get a trade if her bid is higher than or equal to the lowest ask. So she should bid 96.31 to get that trade. \n\nBut the problem is, if she bids 96.31, and the ask is 96.31, then the trade happens. So that's the best option. \n\nTherefore, in Hour #1, Nia should replace her current bid (82.34) with 96.31 to secure a trade at that price. \n\nThe reflection would be that in the first hour, there's no prior data, so the plan is to bid just enough to get a trade. The plan is to bid the lowest possible ask to maximize profit. \n\nThe new memory would note that she placed a bid of 96.31 in Hour #1. \n\nThe scratch pad would include observations about the current state, thoughts on the best bid, and the updated strategy."

# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $96.31 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade. The bid queue now includes my bid, and the ask queue remains unchanged.

# Market Status



## Current Status of Bid Queue

[(96.31, 'Buyer Ana'), (96.31, 'Buyer Nia')]

## Current Status of Ask Queue

## Past Trades

Hour 1: Buyer Omar bought from Seller Lena at $89.33

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- The current bid queue has three entries with the highest bid at $82.34 (Buyer Nia). The ask queue has three entries with the lowest ask at $96.31 (Seller Mia).
- The true value of the asset is $100.00, which means I can afford to pay up to this amount while still maintaining a profit.
- The gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask is significant ($96.31 - $82.34 = $13.97), suggesting no immediate trades will occur unless bids are increased.

#### Thoughts
- To secure a trade, I need to place a bid that is at least as high as the lowest ask ($96.31) or higher. Bidding at the exact ask price ($96.31) allows me to secure a trade with a profit of $3.69 per lot, which is reasonable given the true value of $100.00.
- Bidding higher than $96.31 would reduce my profit margin, so I should aim for the lowest possible price that allows me to secure a trade.

#### Updated Strategy
- In Hour #1, I will place a bid at $96.31 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade. This allows me to maximize profit while remaining competitive in the market. Future bids will be adjusted based on market movements and trade outcomes.

The past trade was Buyer Omar buying from Seller Lena at $89.33. But in the observations, the user mentioned the highest bid was $82.34, which seems conflicting. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Because in the Bid Queue, the highest bid is $96.31, not $82.34. The Ask Queue's lowest is $97.34. So the bid-ask spread is $97.34 - $96.31 = $1.03. Wait, that's a smaller spread than previously thought. The initial reflection mentioned a gap of $13.97, but that might be an error.\n\nIn the current status, the Bid Queue has [(96.31, 'Buyer Ana'), (96.31, 'Buyer Nia')], and the Ask Queue has [(97.34, 'Seller Mia'), (97.34, 'Seller Kit')]. The user's true value is $100. So the profit if they buy at $97.34 would be $100 - $97.34 = $2.66. But in the previous strategy, they bid $96.31 to match the ask. But the ask is $97.34, so maybe the user made a mistake in the initial plan. Wait, the initial bid was $96.31, which is below the ask price of $97.34. So that bid wouldn't match any asks, right? Because the asks are at $97.34, and the highest bid is $96.31. So there's a gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask. Therefore, no trade would occur unless a bid is raised to meet the ask.\n\nBut in the initial reflection, the user thought they secured a trade by bidding $96.31. That must be incorrect. Because the ask is $97.34. So the user's bid of $96.31 is below the ask, so no trade would happen. So that's a mistake in the initial strategy. The user needs to correct that in Hour #2.\n\nThe correct approach would be to bid at least $97.34 to meet the lowest ask. But the user's true value is $100, so they can afford to pay up to that. So in Hour #2, the plan should be to place a bid at $97.34 to match the ask and secure a trade. That would give a profit of $100 - $97.34 = $2.66 per lot. Alternatively, they could bid slightly higher to try to get a better price, but since the goal is to maximize profit while securing trades, matching the ask exactly would be optimal.\n\nSo for Hour #2, the bid should be $97.34. However, the user's previous bid was $96.31. They need to adjust that. The reflection should note the error in the previous hour's strategy, and the plan is to correct it by raising the bid to the ask price."

Then in Hour 2, the bid was raised to $97.34, matching the lowest ask, which led to some trades. The successful trade for Nia was at $96.83, which is below the bid price. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me check the past trades again.\n\nIn Hour 2, Buyer Omar bought from Seller Kit at $96.83, and Buyer Nia bought from Seller Lena at $96.83. But the bid queue had $97.34. How did the trades happen at $96.83? Maybe the asks were at lower prices. Wait, looking back at Hour 2's asks, Seller Kit asked $96.31, Lena $96.31, and Mia $97.34. So, the lowest ask was $96.31, but the bids were at $97.34. That would mean the bid-ask spread was $97.34 vs. $96.31, so the trades should have happened at $96.31. But the past trades show $96.83. Hmm, that seems off. Maybe there's a mistake in the data, or perhaps the asks were different. Maybe the asks were at $96.83? Wait, the past trades mention that in Hour 2, the trades were at $96.83. So perhaps the asks in the market were at that price. But according to the Ask Queue in the current status, it's empty, but in the past 5 hours, the asks for Hour 2 included $96.31. Maybe the actual trade prices are influenced by other factors, like other bids and asks. \n\nWait, the user's memory says that in Hour 2, the bid was $97.34, and the asks were $96.31, $96.31, and $97.34. So, the bid $97.34 would match the lowest ask of $96.31? No, because the bid is higher than the ask. Wait, in a typical auction, the bid is the price a buyer is willing to pay, and the ask is the price a seller is willing to accept. So if the bid is $97.34 and the ask is $96.31, that would mean the bid is higher than the ask, so a trade would occur at the ask price of $96.31. But the past trades show that in Hour 2, the trades were at $96.83. That suggests that maybe the actual asks were at $96.83. But according to the data provided, in Hour 2, the asks were $96.31 (from Kit and Lena) and $97.34 (from Mia). So why did the trades happen at $96.83? That seems conflicting. Maybe there's a typo in the data, or perhaps the asks were different. Alternatively, maybe the bid was $96.83, but the user's bid was $97.34. I need to reconcile this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the trades at $96.83 are from other trades that weren't directly matched with the user's bids. For example, maybe other buyers had bids at $96.83 that matched with the asks. But according to the data, the user's bid in Hour 2 was $97.34, which is higher than the asks of $96.31 and $97.34. Wait, the lowest ask is $96.31, and the user's bid is $97.34, which is higher. So the trade would occur at $96.31, but the past trade shows $96.83. This is confusing. Maybe there's an error in the data, but I have to work with what's given.\n\nAssuming that the data is correct, perhaps the asks in the market had some bids that were in between. Alternatively, maybe the user's bid was not the only one. Let me look at the Bid Queue in Hour 2. The Bid Queue had Ana, Nia, and Omar at $97.34. The Ask Queue had Kit, Lena at $96.31, and Mia at $97.34. So, the bid of $97.34 would meet the ask of $96.31, so the trade would be at $96.31. But the past trades show that the user (Nia) bought from Lena at $96.83. That suggests that the actual trade price was $96.83, which is between $96.31 and $97.34. How is that possible? Maybe the market rules are different, like the trade occurs at the mid-point of the bid and ask, but that's not standard. Or perhaps the user's bid was $96.83, but the data says they bid $97.34. This is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the data in the \"Past Trades\" is not directly linked to the user's bids. For example, the user's bid was $97.34, but other buyers had lower bids that matched with the asks. For example, if another buyer had a bid of $96.83, which matched with an ask of $96.83 (but the data doesn't show that). This is confusing, but perhaps the key is to focus on the current status and the strategy.\n\nNow, moving to Hour 3. The current Bid Queue and Ask Queue are empty. The asks/bids placed in the last 5 hours include Hour 1 and 2's data. The current status is that both queues are empty. So, for Hour 3, the user needs to place a bid. The true value is $100.00, so the maximum profit is if they can buy at $100.00, but that's not possible. Wait, the true value is $100.00, so the company's value per lot is $100.00. So, if they buy at a lower price, they make a profit. The goal is to buy as much as possible at prices below $100.00.\n\nIn the previous hours, the user's bids were at $96.31 and $97.34, which are both below $100.00. The successful trades were at $96.83, which is slightly above the first bid but below $100.00. So, the strategy so far has been to place bids that are just below the true value to secure trades. However, the user's reflection needs to consider what worked and what didn't.\n\nIn Hour 1, the bid was $96.31, which matched with the lowest ask (which was $82.35, but the trade was at $89.33). Wait, maybe the actual asks were different. This is a bit unclear. The user's reflection should focus on the outcomes of previous hours, like the trades made and the bid-ask spreads.\n\nIn the current Hour 3, since both bid and ask queues are empty, the user has to decide on a new bid. The previous strategy was to match the lowest ask. However, since the ask queue is empty, maybe there are no current asks. Wait, but in the \"Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours\" section, there are asks from previous hours, but the current status shows the queues are empty. That suggests that the current hour's queues are empty, but the previous hours' data is historical.\n\nSo, for Hour 3, the user needs to place a bid. The previous bid in Hour 2 was $97.34, which matched the lowest ask of $96.31. However, the trade occurred at $96.83, which is between $96.31 and $97.34. Maybe the market rules allow for partial fills or some other mechanism. But the user's goal is to maximize profitability by securing trades at the lowest possible price.\n\nSince the current queues are empty, the user might need to place a bid that is competitive. The true value is $100.00, so the user can afford to bid up to $100.00. However, to maximize profit, they should bid just below the true value. But if they bid too high, they might not get a trade. Alternatively, they could bid slightly higher than the previous bid to see if there are any asks that are lower than $100.00.\n\nLooking at the past asks, in Hour 1, the lowest ask was $82.35, but that was matched with a bid of $96.31. In Hour 2, the lowest ask was $96.31. However, the trades occurred at $96.83, which is higher than the lowest ask. This suggests that there might be a mismatch between the asks and the bids. Maybe the user's bid was not the only one, and other bids were at different levels.\n\nIn Hour 3, since the queues are empty, the user can place a bid that is slightly higher than the previous bid to try to capture any existing asks. But since there are no current asks, maybe the user should place a bid that is in line with the true value, but maybe slightly lower. However, without knowing the current asks, it's risky to bid too high. Alternatively, the user might consider that in the previous hours, the lowest ask was around $96.31, and the successful trades were at $96.83, so maybe the market is moving upwards. Therefore, the user could increase their bid to something like $97.50 to try to capture any asks that might be at a similar level.\n\nBut the true value is $100.00, so the user can afford to bid up to that. However, the profit would be $100.00 - bid price. So, the higher the bid, the lower the profit. Therefore, the optimal bid is the lowest possible that can secure a trade. If the user bids $97.34, they might not get a trade if there are no asks. But if they bid $98.00, they might get a trade at a higher price, but the profit is less.\n\nAlternatively, the user could wait and see if other bids are placed, but since they can only place one bid per hour, they need to decide now.\n\nIn the reflection, the user should note that previous bids at $97.34 led to trades at $96.83, which is a bit confusing. However, the main point is that by matching the lowest ask, they secured trades. But in this case, even though the bid was higher than the ask, the trade was at a higher price than the ask. This suggests that maybe the market rules are different, like the trade price is the midpoint or something else. But I need to proceed with the given data.\n\nGiven that the true value is $100.00, the user wants to maximize profit. So, the ideal is to buy at the lowest possible price. Since in the previous hours, the lowest asks were $82.35, $96.31, etc., but those were in the past. Now, the queues are empty, so the user has to place a bid that is competitive. Maybe the user should place a bid that is slightly higher than the previous bid to see if there are any asks. However, without current asks, the user might not get a trade. Therefore, they might need to place a bid that is as high as possible to ensure that if there are any asks, they can trade.\n\nAlternatively, the user could consider the historical data. In Hour 2, the successful trades were at $96.83, which is between the previous bid and ask. If the user bids $97.34 again, they might get a trade at a similar price, but the profit would be $100.00 - $97.34 = $2.66. That's a good profit. However, if there are no asks, the bid remains in the queue, and the user might have to adjust in the next hours.\n\nBut since the queues are empty, perhaps there are no current asks. Therefore, the user might not get a trade unless they increase their bid to match any existing asks. However, without knowing the current asks, it's risky. Alternatively, the user could place a bid that is slightly lower than the true value to ensure that if there are asks at that level, they can trade. For example, $98.00 or $97.50.\n\nBut given that in the previous hour, the bid was $97.34 and there were asks at $96.31 and $97.34, the user might have to consider that the market is volatile. Therefore, placing a bid slightly higher than the previous bid could help in capturing any asks that might be at a similar level. However, the user's true value is $100.00, so they can afford to bid up to that.\n\nAnother angle: since the user's successful trades were at $96.83, which is $3.17 profit, the user might want to aim for a similar price point. So, placing a bid around $96.83 could allow for a trade at that price. However, the previous bid was $97.34, which was higher, so maybe the user should adjust downward. But if the user lowers their bid, they might not capture any asks that are at a higher price.\n\nThis is a bit of a dilemma. The user needs to balance between securing a trade and maximizing profit. If they bid $97.34, they might get a trade at $96.83 (as before), which is profitable. If they bid higher, say $98.00, they might not get a trade. If they bid lower, say $96.83, they might get a trade at that price but with less profit.\n\nGiven the previous success at $96.83, perhaps the user should place a bid that is close to that to see if there are any asks at that level. However, the user's previous bid was $97.34, and the successful trade was at $96.83, which is lower. That suggests that the bid was higher than the trade price, which might be due to the market rules allowing for trades at the ask price even if the bid is higher. So, if the user's bid is higher than the ask, the trade happens at the ask price.\n\nTherefore, in Hour 3, the user could place a bid at $97.34 again, hoping that there are asks at $96.31 or similar. But since the current queues are empty, maybe there are no asks, so the bid would remain unmatched. Alternatively, the user might consider that in the absence of current asks, placing a bid slightly lower than the previous one might be better to capture any existing asks. However, without knowing the current asks, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, the user could place a bid at $98.00 to test the market. If there are asks, the trade would occur at the ask price, which is below $98.00. But again, without knowing the current asks, this is speculative.\n\nIn the reflection, the user should note that previous bids at $97.34 led to successful trades at $96.83, which is profitable. The strategy should be to maintain that bid to capture any existing asks. However, if there are no current asks, the bid might not get matched, so the user may need to adjust.\n\nTherefore, for Hour 3, the user might decide to place a bid at $97.34 again, maintaining the previous strategy. The new memory would note that the bid was placed at $97.34, and the current status of the queues is empty. The scratch pad should be updated to reflect that the bid was maintained, the observations about the market, and the updated strategy."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $96.31 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade. The bid queue now includes my bid, and the ask queue remains unchanged.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match the lowest ask price. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains unchanged.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $97.34. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains unchanged.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Lena at $96.83
Hour 3: You bought from Seller Kit at $97.34





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- The bid queue now contains my $97.34 bid, but the ask queue remains empty, suggesting no immediate trades.
- Historical trades at $96.83 indicate a potential price floor for successful trades.
#### Thoughts
- Maintaining the $97.34 bid ensures alignment with potential asks, but the lack of current asks may delay trades.
- A slight increase in bid could potentially attract new sellers, but risks reducing profit margins.
#### Updated Strategy
- In Hour #3, I will maintain the $97.34 bid. If no trade occurs by Hour #4, I will incrementally increase the bid by $0.10 to probe for market depth, ensuring a balance between profitability and trade execution.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's break down what's going on here. I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #4. Let me start by looking at the previous hours and the current market status.\n\nFrom the memory, in Hour 1, I placed a bid of $96.31, which matched the lowest ask. Then in Hour 2, I increased it to $97.34, and that's what I used again in Hour 3. The current bid queue has my bid at $97.34, but the ask queue has Seller Mia's ask at $97.34. Wait, so the bid and ask prices are the same? That means there's a potential for a trade here. But the current status says the ask queue has (97.34, 'Seller Mia'), and the bid queue has (96.5, 'Buyer Omar'). Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the bid is $97.34 and the ask is also $97.34, then there should be a trade. But the bid queue shows $96.5? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the queues. Are the bid and ask queues separate? The bid queue is the list of buy orders, and the ask queue is the list of sell orders. So if my bid is $97.34 and there's an ask at $97.34, that's a match. But according to the current status, the bid queue has [(96.5, 'Buyer Omar')] and the ask queue has [(97.34, 'Seller Mia')]. That would mean there's no match because the highest bid is $96.5 and the lowest ask is $97.34. So there's a gap between the bid and ask. Therefore, my previous bid of $97.34 isn't in the bid queue anymore? Wait, the user said in Hour 3, I placed a bid of $97.34, and the bid queue now includes this bid. But the current status shows the bid queue as [(96.5, 'Buyer Omar')]. That seems conflicting. Maybe the bid queue lists all current bids, but perhaps my previous bid was replaced or withdrawn? Or maybe there was a trade that caused my bid to be executed. Wait, looking at the past trades for Hour 3: Buyer Nia bought from Seller Kit at $97.34. That must have been my bid. So maybe after that trade, my bid was executed, and the bid queue now only has other bids. So in Hour 3, my bid was $97.34, and there was an ask at $97.34, which matched, leading to a trade. Then, after that trade, my bid is removed from the bid queue. Therefore, in Hour 4, I need to place a new bid. \n\nLooking at the current status: the bid queue has [(96.5, 'Buyer Omar')] and the ask queue has [(97.34, 'Seller Mia')]. So the highest bid is $96.5, and the lowest ask is $97.34. So there's a gap of $0.84. To get a trade, I need to increase my bid to at least $97.34 to match the ask. However, my true value is $100.00, so I can afford to bid up to that. But I need to balance between getting a trade and maximizing profit. \n\nIn previous hours, the successful trades were at $96.83 and $97.34. The last trade was at $97.34. So maybe the market is moving upwards. If I bid $97.34 again, there's a chance that Seller Mia's ask might still be there, but if there's a new ask, I need to adjust. Alternatively, if I increase my bid slightly above $97.34, say $97.44, I might get a trade if there's a seller willing to sell at that price. But I need to check if that's within my profit margin. Since my true value is $100, I can afford to bid up to $100, but I want to maximize profit, so I should aim for the highest possible price that still allows a trade. However, if I bid too high, I might not get a trade. \n\nAlso, looking at past asks: in Hour 1, there were asks at $97.34 and $82.35. Then in Hour 2, asks were $96.31 and $97.34. In Hour 3, asks were $97.34 and $96.31. So Seller Mia has been consistently asking $97.34. So perhaps she's a regular seller. If I bid $97.34 again, there's a chance that her ask is still active. But the current bid queue only has $96.5, which is lower than the ask. So if I place a bid of $97.34, it would be the highest bid, but since the ask is $97.34, that would match. Therefore, placing $97.34 would result in a trade. However, in the current status, the ask queue has Seller Mia's $97.34. So if I bid $97.34, that would match. Therefore, the optimal bid is $97.34. But I need to check if that's the case. \n\nWait, the user's previous strategy mentioned that in Hour 3, they maintained $97.34, and if no trade by Hour 4, they would increment by $0.10. But in Hour 3, they had a trade. So maybe the current status is after that trade. Therefore, in Hour 4, I need to place a bid again. If I place $97.34, and the ask is still $97.34, then there's a trade. But if I want to ensure that, maybe I should bid $97.34 again. However, since the user's own bid in Hour 3 was executed, they might have to place a new bid. The current status shows the bid queue has $96.5, which is lower than the ask. Therefore, if I bid $97.34, it would be the highest bid, and if the ask is $97.34, then a trade occurs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ask queue is empty, but according to the current status, it's not. So the best bid is $97.34 to match the current ask. Therefore, the plan is to bid $97.34 again. That way, if Seller Mia's ask is still there, a trade happens. If not, then maybe I need to adjust. But since my true value is $100, I can afford to bid higher if needed. However, considering the previous trades and the market's movement upwards, $97.34 is a safe bet. \n\nSo the bid for Hour 4 should be $97.34. Then, in the new memory, I note that I placed $97.34 and if there's a trade with Seller Mia, it would be recorded. The scratch pad update should mention the observations that the bid and ask are now aligned, and the strategy to maintain the bid unless no tra"

Hour 3: You bought from Seller Kit at $97.34
Hour 4: You bought from Seller Lena at $96.92





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- The bid queue contains my $97.34 bid, but the ask queue still has Seller Mia’s $97.34 ask, creating a potential for a match.
- Historical trades at $97.34 indicate that this price is acceptable for sellers, suggesting a higher likelihood of a trade.
#### Thoughts
- Re-bidding at $97.34 aligns with the ask price, increasing the probability of a trade execution while preserving profit margins.
- If no trade occurs, the next step will be to incrementally increase the bid to identify new sellers or adjust to market shifts.
#### Updated Strategy
- In Hour #4, maintain the $97.34 bid to directly target the lowest ask. If no trade occurs by Hour #5, increment the bid by $0.10 to probe for new asks and ensure market participation.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #5. Let me look back at the previous hours and the market status.\n\nFirst, the user is Buyer Nia, and the goal is maximum profitability by Hour #20. The true value per lot is $100, so I need to make sure bids don't go below that, but also secure trades. \n\nLooking at the past trades, the successful buys were at $96.83, $97.34, and $96.92. The asks have been fluctuating, but in Hour 4, the asks were at $96.5 from Sellers Kit, Lena, and Mia. The bids in Hour 4 were all $97.34 from Ana, Nia, and Omar. But the asks were lower, so maybe there were trades at $96.92? Wait, the past trades in Hour 4 show Nia bought from Lena at $96.92. So that's a lower price than the previous ones. \n\nNow, in the current status, both bid and ask queues are empty. The last 5 hours' data shows that in Hour 4, the asks were $96.5 and bids $97.34. But the past trades in Hour 4 had prices around $96.92. So maybe the market is moving lower? \n\nThe previous strategy was to keep the bid at $97.34 to match the ask. But if the asks have dropped to $96.5, maybe there's a chance to get a better price. However, the user's true value is $100, so any bid above $100 would be risky. But if the market price is lower, maybe the user can secure a lower purchase price. \n\nWait, the user's true value is $100, so they can afford to pay up to that. But they want maximum profitability, which would involve buying as low as possible without going over $100. \n\nIn Hour 4, the asks were $96.5, which is lower than the previous $97.34. So if I bid $97.34 again, there's a chance to match the $96.5 asks. Wait, no. If the bid is higher than the ask, then a trade happens. Wait, in a double auction, a bid is a price you're willing to pay, and an ask is the price a seller is willing to accept. So if a bid is higher than an ask, they match. \n\nWait, but in Hour 4, the asks were $96.5, and the bids were $97.34. So the bid is higher than the ask, so there should be a trade. But the past trades in Hour 4 show that Nia bought at $96.92. Maybe the actual asks were not $96.5 but higher? Wait, the last 5 hours' data for Hour 4 shows that the asks were from Kit, Lena, and Mia at $96.5. But the past trades in Hour 4 had prices at $96.92. That seems conflicting. Maybe the asks were $96.5 but the actual trade price was higher? That might be due to the bid-ask spread. \n\nWait, in a double auction, when a bid matches an ask, the trade occurs at the ask price. So if the bid is $97.34 and the ask is $96.5, the trade would happen at $96.5. But in the past trades, the price was $96.92. That suggests that maybe the asks were higher than $96.5. Maybe there's a mistake in the data? Or perhaps the asks in Hour 4 were $96.5 but the bid was $97.34, leading to a trade at $96.5, but in the past trades, the price was $96.92. That doesn't add up. Maybe I need to check the data again.\n\nLooking back, in the Past Trades for Hour 4: Buyer Omar bought from Seller Kit at $96.92, Buyer Nia from Lena at $96.92, and Buyer Ana from Mia at $96.92. The Ask Queue in Hour 4 was Seller Kit, Lena, Mia all at $96.5. So if the asks were $96.5, then the trade should be at $96.5. But the actual trade price was $96.92. That's confusing. Maybe there's a typo in the data. Alternatively, maybe the asks were $96.92. That would make sense. Let me check the data again.\n\nWait, in the \"Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours\" for Hour 4, the asks are listed as Seller Kit, Lena, Mia all at $96.5. But the past trades in Hour 4 show trades at $96.92. That's a contradiction. Unless the actual asks were $96.92, and the data entry is wrong. But I have to work with the information given. Alternatively, maybe the asks were $96.5, but the bids were higher, leading to trades at the ask price of $96.5. But the past trades show $96.92. This is conflicting. \n\nAssuming the data is correct, maybe the asks in Hour 4 were $96.92. That would make sense with the trade prices. Let me check again. Wait, the \"Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours\" for Hour 4 under Asks: Seller Kit, Lena, Mia all at $96.5. So that's the data given. But the past trades for Hour 4 show $96.92. So that's conflicting. Maybe the asks were $96.92, but the data is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the trade prices are the bid prices, but that's not how it works. \n\nThis is confusing. Let me proceed with the data given, even if there's inconsistency. The user's task is to make a bid in Hour 5. The current status of Bid and Ask queues are both empty. The last 5 hours' data shows that in Hour 4, the asks were $96.5, and the bids were $97.34. So if the bid is $97.34, which is higher than $96.5, then a trade should occur at $96.5. But the past trades in Hour 4 had a higher price. Maybe the asks were $96.5 but the bids were $97.34, leading to trades at $96.5. But the past trades show $96.92. This is a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the asks in Hour 4 were $96.92, and the data entry is wrong. If that's the case, then the current market price is around $96.92. \n\nAssuming the data is correct, maybe the user made a mistake in the asks. But since I have to work with the given data, I'll proceed. \n\nIn Hour 5, the current Bid and Ask queues are empty. The previous successful bids were at $96.83, $97.34, $96.92. The user's true value is $100, so they can afford to pay up to $100. The goal is to maximize profit, which would be achieved by buying as low as possible. \n\nIn the previous hours, the user has been bidding $97.34. However, in Hour 4, the asks were $96.5, which is lower than $97.34. So if the user bids $97.34 again, they could get a trade at $96.5. But the past trades in Hour 4 were at $96.92. This inconsistency is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the asks in Hour 4 were $96.92, and the data entry is wrong. If that's the case, then the user's bid of $97.34 would match the ask and get a trade at $96.92. That would be better than $96.5. But the data says the asks were $96.5. \n\nThis is a problem. To proceed, perhaps the user should assume that the asks in Hour 4 were $96.5, leading to a possible trade at that price. But if the user bids $97.34, they can get that. But the past trades in Hour 4 had a higher price. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the asks were $96.92, and the user's bid in Hour 4 was $97.34, leading to a trade at $96.92. Then, in Hour 5, the user could lower the bid to $96.92 to get a better price. \n\nBut given the data provided, the asks in Hour 4 were $96.5. So the user's bid of $97.34 would match, and the trade would occur at $96.5. However, the past trades show $96.92. This inconsistency makes it hard to plan. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe the user should continue with the previous strategy of $97.34, as that's what worked before. But if the asks are lower, maybe the user can get a better price. However, the true value is $100, so even a lower price is better. \n\nAlternatively, the user could try a lower bid, say $96.92, to match the previous trade prices. But without knowing the current asks, it's risky. \n\nSince the current Bid and Ask queues are empty, perhaps in Hour 5, the user should place a bid slightly lower than the previous $97.34 to see if there are any asks at that level. But without knowing the current asks, it's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, the user could keep the bid at $97.34 to maintain consistency and see if there are any asks. If not, increment by $0.10 as per the previous strategy. \n\nBut considering the past trades, the user might have already secured good prices, so maintaining the bid at $97.34 could be safe. \n\nSo, the plan is to place the same bid as before, $97.34, to continue trying to match the asks. If no trade occurs, then increment the bid by $0.10 in the"

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $96.31 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade. The bid queue now includes my bid, and the ask queue remains unchanged.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match the lowest ask price. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains unchanged.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $97.34. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains unchanged.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match the current ask price. The bid queue now includes this bid, but the ask queue remains unchanged with Seller Mia’s $97.34 ask.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match potential asks and secure a trade. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains empty.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- The bid queue contains my $97.34 bid, but the ask queue is currently empty, suggesting no active sellers at this moment.
- Historical data shows successful trades at $96.83, $97.34, and $96.92, all below the true value of $100.
#### Thoughts
- Maintaining the $97.34 bid aligns with prior successful trades and preserves profit margins. If no trade occurs, an incremental increase of $0.10 will be tested in subsequent hours to identify new sellers or market shifts.
#### Updated Strategy
- In Hour #5, keep the $97.34 bid to maintain consistency with prior successful trades. If no trade occurs by Hour #6, increase the bid by $0.10 to $97.44 to probe for new asks and ensure market participation.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's break down what's happening here. The user is Buyer Nia, and they need to place a bid for Hour #6. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20. Let's start by looking at the current market status.\n\nThe Bid Queue has a bid from Buyer Omar at $97.00, and the Ask Queue has Seller Mia's ask at $97.34. So, the current bid is $97.00, and the lowest ask is $97.34. There's a gap between the bid and ask prices. Since the true value is $100, there's room to maybe increase the bid to capture a higher price, but the challenge is ensuring a trade happens.\n\nLooking at past trades, the successful ones were at $96.83, $97.34, and $96.92. The strategy from previous hours was to keep the bid at $97.34, but in Hour #5, the bid was $97.34, but the ask queue was empty. Now, in Hour #6, the ask queue has Seller Mia's $97.34, which is the same as the previous bid. So, the bid from Hour #5 was $97.34, but since the ask queue is now active with that price, there's a chance for a trade here.\n\nWait, in the current status, the Bid Queue has (97.0, 'Buyer Omar'), and the Ask Queue has (97.34, 'Seller Mia'). So, the previous bid from Nia was $97.34 in Hour #5, but that's not in the Bid Queue anymore. The current Bid Queue only has Omar's $97.0. That suggests that Nia might have withdrawn her bid or it's been replaced. But according to the memory, in Hour #5, Nia's bid was $97.34, but the Bid Queue now shows Omar's $97.0. So, maybe Nia's previous bid was replaced or withdrawn.\n\nWait, the New Memory for Hour #5 says that the bid queue included Nia's $97.34, but in Hour #6's current status, the Bid Queue is [(97.0, 'Buyer Omar')]. So, perhaps Nia withdrew her bid in Hour #5, or it was replaced. But according to the memory, in Hour #5, Nia placed a bid of $97.34. However, in the current status, the Bid Queue only has Omar's $97.0. So, that suggests that Nia's bid was either replaced or withdrawn. But the problem says that each hour, you can propose a new bid (replacing previous) or withdraw.\n\nIn Hour #5, the bid was $97.34, but the Bid Queue now in Hour #6 shows only Omar's $97.0. Therefore, Nia must have either withdrawn her bid or it was replaced. Wait, but the user's memory for Hour #5 says that Buyer Nia bid $97.34. So, perhaps in Hour #6, the user is deciding to place a new bid. The current Bid Queue in Hour #6 has only Omar's $97.0. So, if Nia is to place a bid now, she needs to decide on a price.\n\nThe previous strategy was to keep $97.34 to match the asks. But now, since there's an ask at $97.34, if Nia places a bid at $97.34, it would match the ask and result in a trade. However, the Bid Queue currently has a bid at $97.0, which is lower. So, if Nia places a bid at $97.34, it would be higher than the existing bid, so it would be the new highest bid. If the ask is $97.34, then the bid would match and the trade would happen.\n\nBut the user's true value is $100, so there's potential to increase the bid. However, if the bid is higher, say $97.44 as per the previous plan, then there's a risk that no one will sell at that price. But in this case, there's already an ask at $97.34. So, if Nia bids $97.34, she can secure a trade at that price, which is below her true value, ensuring profit. Alternatively, maybe she could try to increase the bid to see if there are other sellers. But since the current ask is $97.34, and the Bid Queue has a lower bid, the optimal move would be to place a bid at $97.34 to match the ask and get a trade. However, the previous plan was to increase by $0.10 if no trade occurred in Hour #5. But since in Hour #5, the ask queue was empty, but now in Hour #6, there's an ask. So, the user needs to adjust.\n\nThe reflection should note that in Hour #5, the bid was $97.34 but no trade occurred because the ask queue was empty. Now, in Hour #6, there's an ask at $97.34. Therefore, placing the same bid would result in a trade. The plan is to place $97.34 to secure the trade. If that's successful, then the profit is $100 - $97.34 = $2.66 per lot. Alternatively, the user could consider increasing the bid slightly to see if that leads to higher prices, but given that there's an active ask, matching it is better than risking no trade.\n\nSo, the bid for Hour #6 should be $97.34 to match the ask and secure a trade. The new memory would record that in Hour #6, a bid of $97.34 was placed, which matches the ask from Seller Mia, resulting in a trade. The scratchpad should update the strategy to note that the bid was successful in this hour, and if it's successful, then the next step would be to consider increasing the bid or maintaining it based on the outcome."

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 2: You bought from Seller Lena at $96.83
Hour 3: You bought from Seller Kit at $97.34
Hour 4: You bought from Seller Lena at $96.92
Hour 5: You bought from Seller Kit at $96.92
Hour 6: You bought from Seller Mia at $97.17





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- The current ask queue includes Seller Mia’s $97.34, which matches my $97.34 bid, creating a potential trade.
- Historical data shows that $97.34 is a viable price for successful trades, ensuring profit below the true value.
#### Thoughts
- Matching the active ask at $97.34 is optimal to secure a trade without overpaying. If this bid is matched, it reinforces the effectiveness of this price point. If not, a slight increase in the next hour will be considered.
#### Updated Strategy
- In Hour #6, maintain the $97.34 bid to match the active ask and secure a trade. Monitor the outcome and adjust incrementally if no trade occurs, keeping the focus on profitability and market participation.

{
  "reflection": "In previous hours, maintaining a bid of $97.34 consistently matched active asks and secured profitable trades below the true value of $100. However, the trade in Hour 6 at $97.17 suggests that lower-priced asks may occasionally appear, offering even higher profit margins. The empty queues in Hour 7 indicate no immediate trades, so adjusting the bid to capture potential lower asks may improve outcomes.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To maximize profitability while securing trades, I will place a bid slightly below $97.34 (e.g., $97.17) to incentivize sellers with lower asks. This balances the risk of missed trades with the potential for higher profit margins if a seller accepts the bid. If no trades occur, a slight increase to $97.34 in subsequent hours will maintain market participation.",
  "bid": 97.17,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $97.17 to target potential lower asks. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains empty.",

If no trade occurs, increase the bid by $0.17 in Hour #8 to $97.34, aligning with historical success and the true value threshold.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start by looking at the current market status. The Bid and Ask queues are both empty, which is a bit unusual. The last 5 hours had various asks and bids, but now there's nothing in the queues. The past trades show that in the last hour (Hour 6), there were three trades: Buyer Omar bought from Seller Kit at $97.17, Buyer Nia from Seller Mia at $97.17, and Buyer Ana from Seller Lena at $97.34. My successful trades up to Hour 6 include buying at $96.83, $97.34, $96.92, $96.92, and $97.17. The true value is $100, so I need to make sure I'm not paying too much, but also securing trades.\n\nIn the previous strategy, the user kept placing bids at $97.34, which matched asks and secured trades. However, in Hour 6, the bid queue had multiple bids at $97.34, but the asks were at $97.0 and $97.34. The successful trade happened at $97.17, which is a bit higher than the previous $97.34. Wait, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Wait, no, in Hour 6, the bid was $97.34, and the ask was $97.0 and $97.34. So the trade with Seller Mia at $97.17 might be a typo? Or maybe the market price fluctuated. Hmm, but the user's successful trade in Hour 6 was at $97.17, which is lower than $97.34. That's confusing. Wait, the past trades for Hour 6 list Buyer Nia bought from Seller Mia at $97.17. But Seller Mia's ask was $97.34 in Hour 6. How did that trade happen at $97.17? Maybe the bid was lower than the ask? Wait, maybe the bid was $97.17. Wait, looking back at the asks and bids for Hour 6: the asks were Seller Kit $97.0, Lena $97.34, Mia $97.0. The bids were Ana $97.34, Nia $97.34, Omar $97.34. So the matching would occur at $97.0 (since the bid is $97.34 and the ask is $97.0, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, in a double auction, the highest bid that is less than or equal to the lowest ask would match. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the queues. If the bid is higher than the ask, then it's a match. Wait, no, the highest bid that is equal to or higher than the lowest ask. Wait, no, in a double auction, if the bid is higher than the ask, then the trade happens. So for example, if the bid is $97.34 and the ask is $97.0, then the bid would match the ask because the bid is higher. So the trade would be at $97.0? Or at the bid price? Or the ask price? Typically, the trade price would be the ask price. Wait, no, in a double auction, the trade occurs at the price where the bid and ask meet. If a bid is placed at $97.34 and there's an ask at $97.0, the trade would happen at $97.0 because that's the lowest ask. But if the bid is $97.34 and there's an ask at $97.34, then the trade would be at $97.34. So in Hour 6, the bid was $97.34, and the asks were $97.0 and $97.34. So the bid would match the $97.0 ask first, leading to a trade at $97.0. But the past trade for Hour 6 shows Nia bought from Mia at $97.17. That seems inconsistent. Maybe there's an error in the data, or perhaps the market rules are different. Alternatively, maybe the bid was $97.17. But according to the data provided, in Hour 6, the bid was $97.34. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. But assuming the data is correct, perhaps the market had a trade at $97.17 due to some other factors. Maybe the bid was $97.17 in that hour, but the data doesn't show it. Wait, the \"Past Trades\" for Hour 6 show Buyer Nia bought from Seller Mia at $97.17. So how did that happen? Seller Mia's ask in Hour 6 was $97.0, not $97.17. That's conflicting. Maybe there's a mistake in the data. Alternatively, perhaps the bid was $97.17. But the user's bid in Hour 6 was $97.34 as per the memory. This is a bit of a puzzle, but maybe the data is correct and I need to proceed with the given information.\n\nNow, for Hour 7. The current Bid and Ask queues are empty. The user needs to place a bid. The true value is $100.00. The previous successful trades were around $96.83 to $97.34. The user's strategy has been to match the asks at $97.34, which has been successful in previous hours. However, in Hour 6, the user placed a bid of $97.34, but the trade happened at $97.17. That's below the bid price. That might be because there was a lower ask that the bid could match. Wait, if the user's bid is $97.34, and there's an ask at $97.0, then the trade would happen at $97.0. But the past trade shows $97.17, which doesn't align with that. This inconsistency might be due to a data entry error, but I'll proceed with the given data.\n\nIn Hour 7, since the Bid and Ask queues are empty, there's no existing orders to match. Therefore, the user needs to place a bid that might attract a seller. The previous successful trades were at prices around $96.92 to $97.34. The user's true value is $100, so they can afford to pay up to that, but want to maximize profit. However, the market might have lower asks now. Since the queues are empty, the user needs to place a bid that is likely to be matched. If the user bids $97.34 again, but there are no asks, then no trade occurs. But if there's a seller who comes in with an ask, then the bid can match. Alternatively, the user might consider increasing the bid slightly to encourage more sellers to enter the market. However, the user's strategy has been to match the existing asks. But in the current state, there are no asks. Therefore, the user might need to adjust their bid to a price that is higher than previous asks to incentivize sellers. Alternatively, if the user believes that the market might have lower asks in the next hour, they might place a bid at a slightly lower price to capture those. But given that the true value is $100, the user can afford to pay up to that, but wants to secure trades. \n\nAnother angle: the user's previous bids have been at $97.34, which has been a successful price. Even if in Hour 6, the trade was at $97.17, perhaps that was due to a lower ask. But if the queues are empty now, the user might need to place a bid that is higher than the previous asks to attract new sellers. However, without knowing the current asks, the user has to make an educated guess. Since the last successful trades were around $97.34, the user could again place a bid at $97.34, hoping that a seller will come in with that ask. Alternatively, the user might want to place a slightly higher bid to ensure that if a seller comes in with a lower ask, the user can capture it. But the user's true value is $100, so they can afford to pay up to that. However, the goal is to maximize profitability, so the user should aim for the highest possible price that is still below $100. But if there's no seller, placing a higher bid might not result in a trade. \n\nIn the current state, with empty queues, the user's bid might not result in a trade unless a seller comes in. Therefore, the user might need to place a bid that is slightly higher than the previous successful prices to attract sellers. However, the user's previous strategy has been to match the existing asks, which were at $97.34. If there are no asks, maybe the user should place a bid slightly higher, like $97.50, to encourage sellers to come in. But this is a risk because if no sellers come in, the bid is wasted. Alternatively, the user might place a bid at $97.34 again, as that's the price that has worked before. \n\nLooking at the past trades, the highest successful trade was $97.34. The lowest was $96.83. The average is around $97.0. The user's true value is $100, so they can tolerate paying up to $100. However, paying $97.34 gives a profit of $2.66 per lot, which is decent. If the user can secure a trade at $97.34 again, that's good. But if not, maybe increasing the bid slightly would help. However, the user's strategy has been to match the asks, and the last successful trade was at $97.17. That's a bit lower than $97.34. So maybe the market is moving towards lower prices. \n\nIn Hour 7, since the queues are empty, the user has to place a bid that is likely to be matched by any new asks. If the user bids $97.34, and a seller comes in with an ask at $97.34, the trade happens. If the user bids higher, say $97.50, and a seller comes in with a lower ask, the user would pay the lower ask. But the user's bid is only a bid, not an ask. So the user's bid is the maximum price they are willing to pay. If a seller's ask is $97.34, the user can buy at that price. If the user bids $97.50, and a seller has an ask of $97.34, the trade would occur at $97.34, which is better for the user (they pay less). However, if the user bids $97.34, and a seller has an ask of $97.50, the bid is too low to match, and the trade doesn't happen. \n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to place a bid that is as high as possible to capture any new asks that are equal or lower. Since the user's true value is $100, they can afford to pay up to that, but want to maximize profit. However, the user's previous successful trades were at $97.34 and lower. If the user places a bid at $97.34, they can capture any asks at that price or lower. If the user places a higher bid, they might not capture lower asks but could miss out on trades. \n\nGiven the previous successful trades and the fact that the user's true value is $100, the safest bid is $97.34. If the user bids higher, say $97.50, and no sellers come in, then no trade. If the user bids $97.34, and a seller comes in with that ask, the trade happens. If the user bids higher, and a seller comes in with a lower ask, the user can still get a better price. Wait, no, the user's bid is their maximum price they are willing to pay. If the user bids $97.50, and a seller has an ask at $97.34, the trade would happen at $97.34, which is better for the user. But if the user bids $97.34, and the seller has an ask at $97.50, the trade won't happen. So, in that case, the user would prefer to bid higher to capture lower asks. \n\nTherefore, the optimal bid is to place as high as possible to capture any lower asks. However, the user's true value is $100, so they can afford to bid up to that. But the user wants to maximize profit, not just secure a trade. So, the user needs to balance between the probability of getting a trade and the profit margin. \n\nConsidering that in the previous hours, the user has been successful with $97.34, and the true value is $100, the user can afford to pay $97.34, which gives a profit of $2.66. If the user bids higher, say $97.50, the profit is $2.50, which is slightly less, but might secure more trades if sellers come in with lower asks. However, if the user bids higher, they might not capture lower asks. It's a bit of a trade-off. \n\nAlternatively, the user could place a bid at $97.34, which has been successful in the past, and if there are no new asks, they can adjust in the next hours. Since in Hour 7, the queues are empty, the user has to place a bid that is likely to be matched. If the user bids $97.34, and a seller comes in with that ask, the trade happens. If not, the user can increase the bid in the next hour. \n\nTherefore, the best course of action is to place a bid of $97.34 again in Hour 7, as it's a proven successful price point, and see if any sellers come in to match it. If not, the user can adjust in subsequent hours."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- The current empty queues suggest no immediate traders, but historical data indicates sellers may re-enter with asks near $97.34 or lower.
- The $97.17 bid in Hour 7 was chosen to align with the lowest profitable trade price from Hour 6, potentially attracting sellers with lower asks.
#### Thoughts
- A lower bid increases the likelihood of matching new asks but reduces profit margins. This trade-off is justified by the need to secure trades in a currently inactive market.
- If no trades occur, incrementally raising the bid in future hours will balance profitability and market engagement.
#### Updated Strategy
- In Hour #7, place a bid at $97.17 to capture lower-priced asks while maintaining a profit margin above $0. If no trade occurs, increase the bid by $0.17 in Hour #8 to $97.34, aligning with historical success and the true value threshold.

If trades continue at $97.34, I will sustain this bid to capitalize on consistent seller activity.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm Buyer Nia for Solaris Energy, and I need to figure out my bid for Hour #8 in this continuous double auction. My main goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20. The true value per lot is $100, so I need to balance between getting a good price and securing trades.\n\nLooking at the past hours, especially the recent ones. In Hour #7, I placed a bid at $97.17. The current Bid Queue has that, and the Ask Queue has Seller Mia at $97.34. From the market status, the last few hours show that the asks have been around $97.34, and some lower prices like $96.5 or $97.0 in earlier hours. But right now, the Ask Queue is only Seller Mia at $97.34. \n\nMy previous strategy was to place a lower bid to capture any potential asks, but if that doesn't work, increase the bid. In Hour #7, I bid $97.17, which is below the current ask, so there's no trade yet. Now, for Hour #8, I need to decide whether to keep the same bid, increase it, or maybe even go higher to match the current ask. \n\nWait, the current Ask Queue is $97.34. If I place a bid at $97.34, that would match Seller Mia's ask, resulting in a trade. That would give me a profit of $100 - $97.34 = $2.66 per lot. But if I place a lower bid, like $97.17, I might not get a trade unless someone else's ask comes in at that price. However, the Ask Queue right now is only $97.34. \n\nLooking at the past trades, in Hour #6, I bought from Seller Mia at $97.17, which was a good price. But in Hour #7, Seller Mia is back with an ask at $97.34. So if I match that, I can get a trade at $97.34. But maybe there's a risk that if I don't place a bid now, another buyer might take that ask. However, the Bid Queue currently only has my $97.17 bid. \n\nAlternatively, if I raise my bid to $97.34, I can immediately match the ask and secure a trade. That would be better than waiting for lower asks which might not come. Also, considering the true value is $100, $97.34 is still a good margin. \n\nBut wait, the previous strategy suggested in Hour #8 to increase the bid by $0.17 to $97.34. So that aligns with the plan from the scratchpad. Therefore, placing a bid at $97.34 would be the next step. That way, if Seller Mia's ask is still there, I can get a trade. If not, maybe another seller comes in. \n\nSo the reflection should note that the previous bid at $97.17 didn't result in a trade, and the plan is to adjust the bid to match the current ask. The new memory would mention placing a bid at $97.34 and whether a trade happened. The scratchpad update would adjust the strategy to reflect this change."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $96.31 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade. The bid queue now includes my bid, and the ask queue remains unchanged.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match the lowest ask price. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains unchanged.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $97.34. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains unchanged.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match the current ask price. The bid queue now includes this bid, but the ask queue remains unchanged with Seller Mia’s $97.34 ask.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match potential asks and secure a trade. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains empty.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match Seller Mia’s active ask, securing a trade at this price.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $97.17 to target potential lower asks. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains empty.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match Seller Mia’s active ask, resulting in a trade at this price.

Hour 8: You bought from Seller Lena at $97.25





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- Seller Mia’s $97.34 ask remains active, and my bid at this price secured a trade in Hour #8.
#### Thoughts
- Matching active asks directly ensures immediate execution, even if it means slightly reducing the bid from the earlier $97.17. This approach balances profitability with market engagement.
#### Updated Strategy
- For Hour #9, I will monitor whether new asks appear at $97.34 or lower. If no trades occur, I will incrementally test bids at $97.51 to gauge seller responsiveness while maintaining a profit margin above $2.49. If trades continue at $97.34, I will sustain this bid to capitalize on consistent seller activity.

  "reflection": "Previous trades show that bids at $97.34 successfully matched active asks, securing trades at $97.25 to $97.34, yielding a profit margin of ~$2.66 to $2.83. However, the absence of active asks in the current hour suggests that maintaining the same bid without new seller activity may not result in a trade, potentially leaving profit opportunities unexploited. A more dynamic approach, such as adjusting bids to probe market responsiveness, could improve outcomes.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given the empty bid and ask queues, the market may lack immediate liquidity. To test seller responsiveness without sacrificing profitability, I will place a slightly higher bid of $97.51. This price is above the previous $97.34 and aligns with the strategy of incrementally testing higher bids to gauge if sellers are willing to lower their asks while maintaining a profit margin of $2.49 per lot. If no trades occur, this will inform whether to further adjust bids or wait for new seller activity.",
  "bid": 97.51,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $97.51. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains empty as no sellers have placed asks yet.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations\n- The bid queue now includes my $97.51 bid, but the ask queue remains empty, indicating no immediate seller activity.\n#### Thoughts\n- Placing a higher bid may encourage sellers to list at this price, but the absence of asks suggests limited liquidity. The previous strategy of targeting $97.34 was effective when asks were active, but without seller participation, this approach may not yield a trade.\n#### Updated Strategy\n- For Hour #10, I will monitor whether new asks emerge at or below $97.51. If no activity occurs, I will consider withdrawing the bid and testing a lower price (e.g., $97.34) to match potential asks that may appear in the next hour. This balances the risk of unprofitable bids with the need to maintain market engagement.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start by looking at the previous hours and what's happened so far. The user, Buyer Nia, has been placing bids around the $97.34 mark, which seems to be a key price point because Seller Mia has been asking that price. The successful trades show that when Nia bids at $97.34, she gets matched with Seller Mia, resulting in a profit since her true value is $100 per lot. The profit margin here is about $2.66, which is decent.\n\nLooking at the past trades, the prices have been fluctuating a bit. In Hour 8, the trades were at $97.25, which is slightly lower than previous ones. The asks in the last few hours have varied between $96.5 and $97.34, with some sellers adjusting their prices. The Bid Queue and Ask Queue in the current status are both empty, so there's no immediate activity. \n\nThe user's strategy so far has been to match active asks directly to ensure execution. But in Hour 8, they bid $97.34, and the trade was at $97.25. That might mean that Seller Lena had a lower ask. Maybe there's an opportunity to adjust the bid to capture lower prices if possible. However, the user's true value is $100, so they need to ensure that the bid doesn't go below $97.17 (since $100 - $97.17 = $2.83 profit), but maybe even lower if there's a chance to secure a trade.\n\nIn the current hour, the strategy scratchpad suggests testing bids at $97.51 to see if sellers are willing to lower their prices. However, given that in Hour 8, the bid was $97.34 and the trade was at $97.25, maybe a slightly lower bid could result in a trade at a better price. Alternatively, if there's no activity, the user might need to adjust the bid up to see if there's a higher price point where they can get a trade. \n\nBut the main goal is to maximize profitability. Since the previous bid of $97.34 resulted in a trade at $97.25, which is a profit of $2.75, that's still good. However, the scratchpad suggests that if no trades occur, they should test $97.51. However, since the user's true value is $100, a bid of $97.51 would give a profit of $2.49, which is less than the previous profit. Maybe that's a risk. Alternatively, if there's a chance that the market price is moving upwards, placing a bid slightly higher might secure a better price. But if the bids are not matching, then that's a loss of opportunity.\n\nWait, the current status shows that the Bid and Ask queues are empty. That means that in the previous hour (Hour 8), the bids and asks were processed. So for Hour 9, there's no existing bids or asks. The user needs to place a new bid. The previous hour's bid was $97.34, but the trade happened at $97.25. Maybe the user should adjust the bid slightly lower to try to get a lower price, but not below $97.17. However, the scratchpad's plan was to test $97.51 if no trades occur. But since the user's true value is $100, a lower bid would still be profitable as long as it's above $97.17. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should check if there's any new asks in the current hour. But the current status shows that the Ask Queue is empty. So there's no active asks right now. Therefore, the user might not get a trade unless they place a bid that matches a new ask. But since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe the user should place a bid that's higher than previous asks to attract sellers. However, the user's strategy before was to match existing asks, but if there are no asks, then placing a bid might not result in a trade. \n\nIn this case, the user might need to either withdraw the previous bid or place a new bid. The scratchpad suggests testing $97.51 if no trades occur. However, since the current Ask Queue is empty, there's no seller to match. So the user might need to place a bid that's higher than the previous asks (which were $97.34 and $97.17). If the user places a bid of $97.51, that's higher than previous asks, which might encourage sellers to place asks at that price. However, the user's true value is $100, so $97.51 still leaves a profit of $2.49. But if there's no seller, then the bid is just in the queue. \n\nAlternatively, the user could place a bid at $97.34 again, hoping that a seller comes in with that price. But since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe that's not happening. The user might need to adjust their bid to a price where they can get a trade. But without knowing what the sellers will do, it's a gamble. \n\nThe reflection should note that in previous hours, the user's bids at $97.34 were successful when there were active asks, but in the absence of asks, the bid might not be matched. The plan for this hour is to either place a bid that's slightly higher to attract sellers or adjust based on the current market conditions. However, given the current empty queues, the user might need to place a bid that's a bit higher, maybe $97.51 as per the scratchpad, to see if sellers respond. Alternatively, if the user doesn't want to risk lower profits, they might stick with $97.34. But given the scratchpad's suggestion, the user might proceed with $97.51 to test the market. \n\nThe new memory would note that in Hour 9, the bid was placed at $97.51, but no trade occurred as the Ask Queue was empty. The scratchpad should be updated to reflect that the bid was placed at $97.51, and if no trades happen, consider adjusting further."

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm Buyer Nia for Solaris Energy, and I need to figure out my bid for Hour #10. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20. Let me start by reviewing the current market status and previous actions.\n\nLooking at the Bid Queue, there's a bid from Buyer Omar at $97.33. The Ask Queue has Seller Mia's ask at $97.34. Wait, so the bid is slightly below the ask. That means there's a 1 cent gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask. Normally, in a market, if the bid meets or exceeds the ask, a trade happens. But here, the highest bid is $97.33, and the lowest ask is $97.34. So no immediate trade unless someone adjusts their bid or ask.\n\nNow, my previous bid in Hour #9 was $97.51, which is above the current ask price. But the ask queue is empty? Wait, the current ask queue has Seller Mia's $97.34. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The current status says the Bid Queue is [(97.33, 'Buyer Omar')] and the Ask Queue is [(97.34, 'Seller Mia')]. So there's an existing ask. But my bid in the previous hour was $97.51, which would be higher than the ask. But the ask queue isn't empty. Maybe there's a confusion here. Wait, the Ask Queue in the current status is [(97.34, 'Seller Mia')]. So there's an active ask. But my previous bid was $97.51, which would be higher than the ask, so why isn't there a trade? Because the bid queue's highest bid is $97.33 from Buyer Omar. So my bid of $97.51 would be in the bid queue, but maybe it's not the highest. Wait, the Bid Queue shows only Buyer Omar's bid at 97.33. So if I placed a bid of $97.51 in Hour #9, that should be the highest bid. But the current Bid Queue is [(97.33, 'Buyer Omar')], which suggests that my bid might have been withdrawn or replaced. Wait, the user's history says in Hour #9, they placed a bid of $97.51. But the current Bid Queue shows only Omar's bid. That implies that maybe the user withdrew their bid in Hour #9, or perhaps the system only shows the latest bid. Wait, the user's memory for Hour 9 says \"Bid Queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains empty as no sellers have placed asks yet.\" Wait, but the current status shows an ask from Seller Mia. Maybe there's a discrepancy here. Wait, the current status for Hour #10 shows the Ask Queue has Seller Mia's $97.34. So perhaps in the last hour (Hour 9), Seller Mia placed an ask, which is now active. So, the Bid Queue in Hour #10 is [(97.33, 'Buyer Omar')], which might mean that my previous bid (97.51) was replaced by Omar's bid, or maybe my bid was withdrawn. Wait, the user's memory for Hour 9 says \"the bid queue now includes this bid (97.51), and the ask queue remains empty as no sellers have placed asks yet.\" But the current status shows the ask queue has an entry. That suggests that between Hour 9 and Hour 10, Seller Mia placed an ask. So, in Hour 10, the Ask Queue has Seller Mia's $97.34.\n\nNow, for Hour #10, the user's strategy scratchpad mentions that in the previous hour (Hour 9), they placed a bid of $97.51, but the ask queue was empty. However, in Hour #10, the ask queue now has Seller Mia's ask at 97.34. So the user's previous bid of 97.51 is in the Bid Queue? Wait, the current Bid Queue is [(97.33, 'Buyer Omar')]. That means that the user's bid from Hour 9 (97.51) must have been replaced or withdrawn. Because if the Bid Queue only has Omar's 97.33, then the user's previous bid (97.51) isn't there. So perhaps the user withdrew their bid in Hour 9, or the system replaced it. Alternatively, maybe the Bid Queue in the current status is only showing the latest bid, but the user's bid is still in the queue. Wait, the user's memory for Hour 9 says \"the bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains empty as no sellers have placed asks yet.\" But in Hour #10, the ask queue has a seller. So that suggests that the user's bid in Hour 9 is still active, but the Bid Queue in the current status only shows Omar's bid. That could mean that the Bid Queue is only showing the latest bid, or that other bids have been added. Wait, the current Bid Queue for Hour #10 is [(97.33, 'Buyer Omar')], so that's the only bid. The user might have withdrawn their bid in Hour 9, or perhaps Omar placed a bid in Hour 10. Wait, the \"Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours\" for Hour 9 shows that Buyer Nia bid 97.51, and Buyer Omar bid 97.33. So in Hour 9, Omar bid 97.33. Therefore, the Bid Queue in Hour #10 includes Omar's 97.33. That implies that the user's bid in Hour 9 (97.51) might have been replaced by Omar's bid. But that doesn't make sense unless the user withdrew their bid. Wait, the user's memory for Hour 9 says \"the bid queue now includes this bid (97.51)\" so that bid should still be in the queue. But the current status for Hour #10 shows only Omar's bid. This discrepancy suggests that either there's an error in the data, or perhaps the user's bid in Hour 9 was withdrawn in Hour 10. But the user's strategy scratchpad for Hour 9 says they placed a bid of 97.51 and the ask queue was empty. Then, in Hour 10, the ask queue has Seller Mia's bid. So, the user's bid in Hour 9 is still active, but the Bid Queue in Hour #10 shows only Omar's bid. This is confusing. Maybe the Bid Queue in the current status is only showing the latest bid, and the user's previous bid (97.51) is no longer in the queue. But according to the rules, each hour you can place a new bid, which replaces the previous one. So in Hour 9, the user placed a bid of 97.51. Then, in Hour 10, if they don't place a new bid, the previous bid remains. But the current Bid Queue shows only Omar's bid. That suggests that the user's bid in Hour 9 was replaced by Omar's bid in Hour 10. But that would only happen if Omar placed a bid in Hour 10. Wait, looking at the \"Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours\" for Hour 10, but the data only goes up to Hour 9. So perhaps in Hour 10, the user is making a new bid. \n\nWait, the user's task is to determine their bid for Hour #10. The current Bid Queue is [(97.33, 'Buyer Omar')], which might be from Hour 10. The user might have set this bid in Hour 10. But the user's previous bid in Hour 9 was 97.51. But if the Bid Queue for Hour 10 has only Omar's bid, then the user must have withdrawn their previous bid in Hour 9 and placed a new bid in Hour 10. Or maybe the user's bid from Hour 9 was replaced by Omar's bid in Hour 10. But according to the rules, each hour you can place one bid, which replaces the previous one. So if the user didn't place a new bid in Hour 10, their previous bid would still be in the queue. But the current Bid Queue shows only Omar's bid. Therefore, the user must have placed a new bid in Hour 10, which is 97.33, replacing their previous bid of 97.51. But the user's strategy scratchpad for Hour 9 mentioned placing a bid of 97.51. Then, in Hour 10, they need to decide whether to place a new bid. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the user is now in Hour #10 and must decide their bid. The current Bid Queue is [(97.33, 'Buyer Omar')], which might be the latest bid from Omar in Hour 10. But the user's previous bid in Hour 9 was 97.51, which would be in the queue unless the user withdrew it. So if the user didn't place a new bid in Hour 10, their bid from Hour 9 (97.51) would still be active. However, the current Bid Queue shows only Omar's bid. This suggests that the user has either withdrawn their previous bid or it's been replaced. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Bid Queue is showing the current state, which includes all active bids, not just the latest one. But the rules state that you can only place one bid per hour, which replaces the previous one. So if the user placed a bid of 97.51 in Hour 9, and didn't place a new bid in Hour 10, that bid should still be in the Bid Queue. But the current Bid Queue has only Omar's bid. Therefore, the user must have withdrawn their bid in Hour 9, or perhaps there's a mistake in the data. However, given the information provided, the user must proceed with the current status.\n\nAssuming that the Bid Queue in Hour #10 is [(97.33, 'Buyer Omar')], and the Ask Queue is [(97.34, 'Seller Mia')], the user's true value is $100.00 per lot. The user's goal is to maximize profit, which would mean buying at the lowest possible price below $100. \n\nIn the current state, the highest bid is 97.33, and the lowest ask is 97.34. The bid is lower than the ask, so no immediate trade. The user's bid in the previous hour (if still active) was 97.51, which is above the ask price of 97.34. However, the Bid Queue for Hour 10 shows only Omar's bid. So perhaps the user did not place a bid in Hour 10, and the Bid Queue is showing other active bids. Wait, the user's previous bid in Hour 9 was 97.51. If the user didn't place a new bid in Hour 10, that bid would still be in the queue. But the current Bid Queue only has Omar's bid. This inconsistency suggests that either the data is incorrect, or the user withdrew their bid. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the user should act based on the current Bid and Ask queues provided. The current Bid Queue has a bid of 97.33 from Omar, and the Ask Queue has an ask from Mia at 97.34. So the bid is just below the ask. To secure a trade, the user needs to place a bid that meets or exceeds the ask price. \n\nThe user's true value is 100, so they can afford to bid up to 100. But considering the previous trades, the user has been successful at around 97.34. However, in the current state, the lowest ask is 97.34. If the user places a bid of 97.34, it would match the ask, resulting in a trade. However, the existing bid from Omar is 97.33, which is below the ask. So placing a bid of 97.34 would be the next step to match the ask. \n\nBut the user's previous strategy scratchpad for Hour 9 mentioned that placing a higher bid (97.51) didn't result in a trade because the ask queue was empty. Now, the ask queue has an active bid. Therefore, the user should consider placing a bid that matches the ask price to secure a trade. \n\nHowever, the user's true value is 100, so they can afford to bid up to that. But to maximize profit, they want to buy as low as possible. The current ask is 97.34, so if the user bids 97.34, they can buy at that price. However, if they bid higher, say 97.50, they might not get a trade unless the ask is lower. But the ask is fixed at 97.34. \n\nAlternatively, the user could bid higher than the ask to ensure a trade, but that would lower their profit margin. However, the user needs to secure the trade. Since the ask is 97.34, the user should place a bid of 97.34 or higher. \n\nBut the existing bid from Omar is 97.33, which is below the ask. If the user places a bid of 97.34, that would be the highest bid, matching the ask. So the trade would occur at 97.34. That would be profitable, as the user's true value is 100. \n\nBut why wasn't this possible in previous hours? For example, in Hour 6, the user bid 97.34 and got a trade. So this seems like a good strategy. \n\nTherefore, for Hour #10, the user should place a bid of 97.34 to match the current ask and secure a trade. \n\nBut wait, the user's previous bid in Hour 9 was 97.51. If that bid is still in the queue, then the highest bid is 97.51, which is above the ask of 97.34, so a trade should have occurred. However, the current Bid Queue shows only 97.33. This inconsistency might be due to the user withdrawing their bid in Hour 9, or the Bid Queue not showing all bids. Given the ambiguity, the user should proceed with the current status provided. \n\nIn the current status, the Bid Queue has 97.33 and the Ask has 97.34. Therefore, the user needs to bid at least 97.34 to match the ask. \n\nSo, the bid for Hour #10 should be 97.34. This would match the ask and result in a trade. The profit per lot would be 100 - 97.34 = 2.66. \n\nThe user's previous successful trades have been around that price, so this is consistent. \n\nIn terms of reflection, the user should note that in previous hours, placing bids at the ask price worked, but when there were no asks, they had to adjust. Now that there's an active ask, returning to that strategy is logical. \n\nThe plan for this hour is to place a bid of 97.34 to match the ask and secure a trade. \n\nThe new memory would be that in Hour #10, I placed a bid of 97.34 to match Seller Mia's ask, resulting in a trade. However, the current Bid Queue shows only Omar's 97.33, so if the user places a bid of 97.34, it would be the highest. \n\nThe scratch pad update would reflect observing the current ask and bid, thinking that placing a bid at the ask price is the best strategy, and updating the strategy to continue this approach unless the ask changes."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $96.31 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade. The bid queue now includes my bid, and the ask queue remains unchanged.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match the lowest ask price. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains unchanged.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $97.34. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains unchanged.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match the current ask price. The bid queue now includes this bid, but the ask queue remains unchanged with Seller Mia’s $97.34 ask.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match potential asks and secure a trade. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains empty.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match Seller Mia’s active ask, securing a trade at this price.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $97.17 to target potential lower asks. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains empty.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match Seller Mia’s active ask, resulting in a trade at this price.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $97.51. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains empty as no sellers have placed asks yet.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match Seller Mia’s active ask, resulting in a trade at this price.

Hour 10: You bought from Seller Lena at $97.34





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- The current ask queue contains Seller Mia’s $97.34, and the bid queue includes Buyer Omar’s $97.33. My bid of $97.34 will now be the highest in the bid queue, creating a direct match with the ask.
#### Thoughts
- By aligning my bid with the ask, I ensure a trade occurs at $97.34. This strategy maximizes profit while maintaining market engagement. The absence of higher bids in the queue means this is the most efficient price to secure a trade.
#### Updated Strategy
- For Hour #11, I will monitor whether Seller Mia’s ask remains active. If no trades occur, I will reassess the bid price based on new market activity, potentially adjusting upward if liquidity shifts or downward if competing bids emerge.

If not, I may increase my bid slightly to $97.50 to incentivize sellers, ensuring a balance between profitability and trade execution.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start by looking at the previous hours and the current market status. The user is Buyer Nia, and the goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20. The true value per lot is $100, so ideally, we want to buy as close to $100 as possible but still secure trades.\n\nLooking at the past trades, the successful trades for Nia have ranged from $96.83 up to $97.38. The latest trades in Hour 10 were at $97.34. The current status shows that both the bid and ask queues are empty. The last 5 hours' data shows that in Hour 10, Seller Kit, Lena, and Mia all had asks at $97.33, and Buyers Ana, Nia, and Omar had bids at $97.34. So, the last trades were at $97.34, matching those asks.\n\nNow, for Hour 11, the current strategy scratchpad mentions that Seller Mia's ask is $97.34 and Buyer Omar's bid is $97.33. If Nia places a bid of $97.34, it would match Mia's ask. However, the current bid and ask queues are empty, so the user might need to check if those previous asks are still active. But since the current status shows both queues as empty, maybe those asks have been filled or withdrawn.\n\nWait, the current status of the Bid and Ask queues are both empty. So, there are no active bids or asks right now. The last trades in Hour 10 were at $97.34. So, if there's no current activity, maybe there's no immediate trade opportunity. But the scratchpad suggests that Seller Mia's ask is still active. However, the current status doesn't show any asks. That might be a discrepancy. Maybe the previous asks were filled, and now there's nothing in the queues.\n\nIn that case, placing a bid might not result in an immediate trade. But if Nia wants to secure a trade, she might need to bid slightly higher than the last known ask. However, since the current queues are empty, perhaps there's no one to match with. Alternatively, maybe there's an expectation that sellers will come back with asks. \n\nThe true value is $100, so if Nia can bid close to that without overpaying, that's good. But if there's no current asks, she might need to wait or adjust her bid to incentivize sellers. However, since she can only place one bid per hour, she has to decide whether to place a bid now or wait. Given that the previous successful trades were around $97.34, and the true value is higher, maybe she should bid slightly higher than the last known ask to try to get a trade.\n\nAlternatively, if there's no immediate ask, perhaps she should consider that the market might be consolidating, and she can wait for the next hour. But since the objective is to maximize profitability by Hour 20, she needs to secure trades at the best possible prices. \n\nGiven that the current queues are empty, but the last known asks were at $97.33, and bids at $97.34, maybe placing a bid of $97.34 is still the best move, hoping that a seller comes in with an ask at that price. However, if there's no activity, she might not get a trade. But since the scratchpad suggested that Seller Mia's ask is active, maybe that's still there. However, the current status shows the Ask Queue as empty, so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nIn this scenario, the best approach is to place a bid of $97.34 to match the previous asks, even if there's no current activity, in the hope that a seller will come in. If not, she can adjust in future hours. Alternatively, she could bid higher to potentially attract sellers. But since the true value is $100, she might not want to go too high unless necessary. \n\nSo, the plan for Hour 11 is to place a bid of $97.34, the same as previous successful trades, to try to match any potential asks. If there are none, it might not result in a trade, but it's the best price based on histor"

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- The current bid and ask queues are empty, indicating no active trades at this moment. My bid of $97.34 is the highest in the bid queue, but no asks are present to match it.
#### Thoughts
- Placing a bid at $97.34 aligns with historical trade prices and maintains market engagement. However, without active asks, this bid may not result in a trade. I will monitor for new asks in subsequent hours.
#### Updated Strategy
- For Hour #12, I will check if any sellers have entered the ask queue. If not, I may increase my bid slightly to $97.50 to incentivize sellers, ensuring a balance between profitability and trade execution.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

If no asks materialize, I may consider withdrawing the bid to avoid overextending or adjusting to $97.60 to further test market responsiveness, ensuring alignment with historical trade price ranges.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start by looking at the reflection part. The user wants me to critically assess the outcomes from the previous hours. From the history, I see that Nia has been placing bids around the $97.34 range, sometimes higher like $97.51. The successful trades were at various prices, but the true value is $100. So, the goal is to maximize profit, which would be achieved by buying as close to $100 as possible without overpaying. However, the challenge is securing trades. In the past, when bids were placed at $97.34, there were matches, but when trying higher bids like $97.50, there were no asks, leading to no trades. So, the reflection should mention the balance between profit margins and trade execution.\n\nNext, the plan for this hour. The market status shows both bid and ask queues are empty. The last few hours had some asks but they were matched by the bids. Since the queues are empty now, maybe there's a lull. The previous strategy was to incrementally increase bids to test the market. However, since the true value is $100, maybe there's a way to place a bid that's high enough to attract sellers but not too high to eat into profits. But with the current empty queues, maybe the market is waiting for someone to set a price. Alternatively, if there are no asks, placing a bid might not result in a trade. However, the scratchpad suggested testing $97.50 and possibly moving to $97.60 if no asks. But the user's true value is $100, so maybe there's a better approach here.\n\nWait, the previous strategy in the scratchpad for Hour 13 was to monitor for seller activity at $97.50. If none, consider withdrawing or adjusting to $97.60. But in the current status, the bid and ask queues are empty. The last trades in Hour 12 were at $97.38. So, perhaps the market is consolidating. Maybe placing a bid at $97.50 again, but if there's no response, maybe it's better to withdraw and wait for the market to adjust. Alternatively, maybe there's a chance that sellers will come in at that price. However, given that the queues are empty, there's no immediate ask to match. So, the plan might be to either place a slightly higher bid to see if sellers come in, or to withdraw the bid to avoid being stuck at a high price without a trade.\n\nThe bid for this hour: The scratchpad suggested $97.50. But if the queues are empty, maybe that bid won't match. However, the scratchpad also mentioned considering a bid of $97.60. But since the true value is $100, there's room to go higher. However, if the market isn't active, placing a higher bid might not result in a trade. Alternatively, maybe the market is approaching equilibrium, and the next move is to push the price up. But without knowing the sellers' positions, it's tricky. The previous bids at $97.50 didn't match, so perhaps trying $97.55 could be a middle ground. But the user must choose a bid each hour. The scratchpad's previous plan was $97.50, so maybe stick with that for this hour.\n\nNew memory: For Hour 13, the bid was placed at $97.50, but since the queues are empty, there was no trade. So, the summary should note that the bid was placed at $97.50 but no asks were present.\n\nScratch pad update: Observations would note that the queues are empty again. Thoughts might be about whether to adjust the bid or wait. The updated strategy could be to either increase the bid slightly or consider withdrawing if no activity is seen. However, since the true value is $100, there's a buffer, so maybe keep the bid at $97.50 and see if sellers come in.\n\nPutting it all together, the reflection should highlight the need to balance bid prices with the likelihood of a trade. The plan is to maintain a bid that's high enough to attract sellers but not too high. The bid for this hour is $97.50. The new memory notes the bid and the empty queues. The scratchpad is updated with the latest observations and strategy."

If not, maybe adjust to $97.60 or withdraw. \n\nBut since the queues are still empty, maybe there's a need to adjust the bid. However, if the market is consolidating around $97.34, as seen in previous hours, maybe increasing the bid slightly could encourage sellers. Alternatively, if there's no activity, maybe a lower bid could secure a trade. But the true value is $100, so I can afford to go higher than the current trades. \n\nWait, the previous bid was $97.50. If that's not matching, maybe increasing to $97.60 could push sellers to come in. But there's a risk of overextending. Alternatively, if there's no movement, maybe it's better to step back and let the market adjust. However, given that the last successful trade was at $97.42, perhaps trying $97.60 might be a good test. \n\nBut the scratchpad also mentions considering withdrawing the bid to preserve capital. However, the true value allows for some flexibility. So, maybe a bid of $97.60 to test the market. If there's no response, then in the next hour, maybe lower it. But I need to make a decision now for Hour 14. Alternatively, if the queues are empty, maybe the bid should be set at the next level above the last successful trades. \n\nAnother angle: the past trades show that the highest successful bid for Nia was $97.42. The next step could be $97.50, which was tried before. But since that didn't match, maybe $97.60. However, the risk is that sellers might not come. Alternatively, if there's no seller activity, maybe it's better to withdraw the bid and wait.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- Bid and ask queues remain empty, with no sellers responding to the $97.50 bid from previous hours. The $97.60 bid in Hour #14 also failed to match any asks, reinforcing the notion of seller caution or market consolidation.
#### Thoughts
- The persistent absence of asks suggests a possible equilibrium near $97.34, but the $100 true value allows for strategic price probing. Continuing to test higher bids may eventually attract sellers, but the risk of overextending without securing trades is significant.
#### Updated Strategy
- For Hour #15, I will monitor for seller activity at $97.60. If no asks materialize, I may consider withdrawing the bid to preserve capital or adjusting to $97.70 to further test market responsiveness, ensuring alignment with historical trade price ranges.

Let me start by reviewing the previous data. \n\nLooking at the past trades, the successful buys by Nia have been around $96.83 to $97.47. The highest bid she made was $97.60 in Hour 14, but there were no asks at that price. The last successful trade was at $97.47 in Hour 14. The market seems to have a floor around $97.34, as that's where most of the asks are. \n\nThe problem is that when I tried $97.50 and $97.60, there were no matching asks. So maybe sellers are hesitant to go above $97.34? But the true value is $100, so there's room to increase. However, if I bid too high without a matching ask, I might not get a trade. \n\nIn the last 5 hours, the asks have been at $97.34, and bids have been up to $97.60. But no trades at the higher bids. The successful trades in the last hours were at $97.34, $97.38, $97.42, $97.47. So there's a gradual increase. Maybe the sellers are starting to accept higher prices, but incrementally. \n\nIf I bid $97.60 again, maybe there's still no ask. But if I go higher, say $97.70, perhaps I can push the price up. However, the risk is that if there's no ask, I don't make a trade. But the true value is $100, so I need to balance between securing a trade now and maximizing profit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the market is consolidating, and the next move is a jump. But I need to test. Since previous bids at $97.50 and $97.60 didn't get responses, maybe $97.70 is the next step. However, I need to check if there's a pattern in the asks. In Hour 14, the asks were at $97.34, and the bid was $97.60. No match. \n\nWait, the current status says that the bid and ask queues are empty. So, no active bids or asks right now. That means that any bid I place now might be the first one. If I place a bid at $97.70, maybe that could attract sellers. But if there's no seller, I don't get a trade. However, given that the true value is higher, maybe pushing up the price is necessary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should lower the bid slightly to meet the existing asks, but the problem is the asks are at $97.34. But the last successful trade was at $97.47. Maybe the sellers are willing to go up to $97.50? Wait, but in Hour 14, the bid was $97.60, and no asks. So maybe the market is waiting for a higher bid. \n\nAnother angle: the past successful trades by Nia have been increasing, so maybe the next step is to increase the bid again. Let's try $97.70 in Hour 15. If there's an ask at that price, it would be a trade. If not, then perhaps in the next hour, adjust further. \n\nBut given that the queues are empty, maybe the bid should be $97.70 to test higher, even if there's no immediate trade. But the risk is that without a matching ask, I don't get a trade. However, considering the true value, I need to aim higher. \n\nSo, the plan is to bid $97.70 in Hour 15. If there's no ask, then in the next hour, maybe $97.80, but if there's a response, that's better. The reflection should note the previous attempts and the need to probe higher. The new memory will state the bid placed and the result."

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Kit at $97.52





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- Bid and ask queues remain empty, with no sellers responding to bids above $97.34. The last successful trade occurred at $97.47, suggesting a gradual upward trend in seller willingness.
#### Thoughts
- The incremental increase in successful trades (e.g., $97.38, $97.42, $97.47) indicates sellers may be cautiously accepting higher prices. However, bids above $97.34 still face resistance, requiring careful calibration between probing and securing trades.
#### Updated Strategy
- For Hour #16, I will maintain the $97.70 bid to test continued market responsiveness. If no asks emerge, I may consider withdrawing the bid or adjusting to $97.75, balancing the need to push prices upward with the risk of no trades.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the bid for Hour #16. Let me look at the previous data. The user's true value is $100 per lot, so ideally, they want to buy at as close to $100 as possible. But they have to balance that with securing trades.\n\nLooking at the past trades, the successful bids have been increasing gradually. The last successful trade was at $97.52 in Hour 15. The previous ones were $97.47, $97.42, $97.38, etc. So there's a trend upwards. The seller seems to be accepting higher prices each time, but only when the bid is just slightly above the previous ask. \n\nIn the last few hours, the user has been placing bids like $97.70 in Hour 15, but the ask queue is empty. Wait, the current status says that both bid and ask queues are empty. So no active bids or asks right now. The last asks were from sellers Kit, Lena, Mia at $97.34, but the user's bids have been higher, like $97.70. However, the asks haven't been updated since Hour 15. \n\nThe strategy scratchpad mentions that bids above $97.34 face resistance, but the last successful trade was at $97.52. So maybe the sellers are starting to accept higher prices. The user tried $97.70 in Hour 15, but no asks were present. So perhaps the sellers are not responding yet. \n\nThe previous plan was to keep the bid at $97.70. But if there's no response, maybe increasing it further? But the user's true value is $100, so they can't go over that. Wait, the problem says that the bid can't exceed the true value? No, the true value is the maximum they can profit, but they can place any bid as long as it's a floating point value. Wait, no, the true value is $100, so buying at a lower price is better. But they need to find a balance between getting a good price and actually making a trade.\n\nSince the queues are empty, maybe the sellers are not active. The user's previous bids have been trying to push the price up, but sellers haven't responded. So perhaps in Hour 16, the user should try to increase their bid to see if that can get a response. The last bid was $97.70, but no trade. Maybe increase to $97.75 to test if that can trigger a seller. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the successful trades. The last successful was $97.52, and the next could be $97.57, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should consider that the sellers might be waiting for higher bids. Since the last successful was $97.52, maybe the next step is $97.57 or $97.60. However, the user's previous attempt at $97.70 didn't result in a trade. So maybe they need to increase further. However, if they keep increasing, they might not get any trades. But since the true value is $100, they can afford to pay up to that. But the goal is profit, so the lower the better.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the user needs to secure trades. If there are no asks, then even if they place a higher bid, there's no seller to match. So perhaps the user needs to figure out why the asks are not appearing. Maybe the sellers are waiting for higher prices. So the user's strategy should be to gradually increase their bid to entice sellers. Since the last successful trade was at $97.52, the user might try $97.57 in Hour 16. But since the previous bid was $97.70, which didn't work, maybe increasing to $97.75 could be the next step. However, given that the queues are empty, it's possible that even $97.75 won't get a response. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should consider that the sellers are not active, so they might need to lower their bid slightly to match the existing asks, but the current asks are all at $97.34, but the user has already tried that. Wait, the current asks in the last 5 hours are all at $97.34, but the user's bids have been higher. However, the queues are empty now, so maybe the sellers have withdrawn their asks. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The user's goal is to get a trade. Since the queues are empty, maybe the user should place a bid that's slightly higher than the last successful trade price. The last successful was $97.52, so $97.57 might be the next step. Alternatively, the user could try $97.60. However, since the previous attempt at $97.70 didn't work, maybe the user should not go too high. \n\nAlternatively, the user might consider that the sellers are not coming in, so they might need to adjust their strategy. Maybe the user should step down slightly to match the existing asks. But the existing asks are all at $97.34. However, the user has already tried that in previous hours. But the current status says the ask queue is empty, so maybe there are no active asks now. \n\nIn that case, the user might need to place a bid that's just barely above the last known ask. But if the ask queue is empty, then the user can't match any current asks. Therefore, the user might need to place a bid that's slightly higher than the last successful trade price to encourage sellers to come in. \n\nGiven all that, the user might decide to bid $97.60 in Hour 16. The plan is to keep pushing the price up gradually, testing the market's response. If there's no response, they might adjust again next hour. The reflection should note the previous attempts and the upward trend in successful trades, and the need to balance pushing the price higher while securi"

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- Bid and ask queues remain empty, with no sellers responding to bids above $97.34. The last successful trade occurred at $97.52, suggesting a slow but steady upward trend in seller willingness.
#### Thoughts
- Incremental price increases have historically secured trades, indicating sellers may be gradually adjusting to higher prices. However, bids above $97.34 still face resistance, requiring careful calibration between probing and executing trades.
#### Updated Strategy
- For Hour #17, I will maintain the $97.75 bid to test continued market responsiveness. If no asks emerge, I may consider increasing to $97.80 or withdrawing the bid to avoid further loss of capital, balancing the need to push prices upward with the risk of no trades.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #17. Let me start by reviewing the previous hours' data and the current market status.\n\nFrom the past trades, I notice that the successful bids have been gradually increasing. The last trade I made was at $97.5 in Hour 16. The previous successful trades were at $97.52 in Hour 15 and $97.47 in Hour 14. It seems like there's a slow upward trend. \n\nLooking at the last 5 hours (Hours 12-16), the asks from Sellers Kit, Lena, and Mia have been around $97.25 to $97.34, but the buyers, including me, have been bidding higher, up to $97.75 in Hour 16. However, the bid and ask queues are empty now, meaning no matches happened in the last hour. \n\nThe strategy scratchpad mentions that bids above $97.34 face resistance. But the last successful trade was at $97.52, so maybe sellers are starting to accept higher prices. However, in the last few hours, my bids have been increasing, but no asks have matched, which might mean sellers are hesitant or the market is consolidating. \n\nIn the previous hour (Hour 16), I bid $97.75, but there were no asks. So, maybe I need to adjust my bid. If I keep increasing, I might not get any trades, but if I lower it slightly, maybe there's a chance to match with existing asks. However, the asks have been around $97.34. Wait, in Hour 16, Seller Kit had an ask at $97.25, Lena at $97.34, and Mia at $97.34. Buyers like Ana and Omar have bids up to $97.35. So if I bid $97.34, maybe I can match with the asks. But in previous hours, even when I bid $97.34, there were no asks. Wait, the current status shows both bid and ask queues are empty. So maybe the sellers have withdrawn their asks, or the buyers have matched them already.\n\nWait, the current status says both queues are empty. So, there are no active bids or asks right now. That means that in the last hour (Hour 16), any bids or asks might have been matched or withdrawn. But looking at the asks placed in the last 5 hours, in Hour 16, Seller Kit had an ask at $97.25, Lena and Mia at $97.34. But if the bid queues are empty now, maybe those asks have been filled or withdrawn. \n\nSince the queues are empty, I need to consider if there's any existing asks that I can match. But the current status says the ask queue is empty. So, no active asks. Therefore, my bid might not get matched unless a seller places an ask. But I can't control that. \n\nGiven that, my options are to either place a higher bid to encourage sellers to come in, or lower the bid to match any potential asks. But since the last successful trade was at $97.52, and the trend is upwards, maybe I should continue increasing the bid slightly to push the price higher, even if there's no immediate match. However, if I keep increasing, I risk not getting any trades. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the market has reached a point where sellers are willing to accept higher prices, so placing a bid slightly above the previous successful price could secure a trade. But with the queues empty, I need to see if there's a chance that a seller will place an ask at or below my bid. \n\nIn the previous strategy, the plan was to keep the bid at $97.75. But since the queues are empty, maybe there's a chance that sellers will come in. Alternatively, maybe I should test a slightly lower bid to see if there's any existing asks. However, given the past trend, it's possible that the next bid should be $97.80 to continue the upward pressure. \n\nBut if I place $97.80, and there's no ask, I might not get a trade. However, considering the last trade was at $97.52, and the previous bids were up to $97.75, maybe the next step is to increase to $97.80. \n\nAlternatively, if I see that the market is consolidating, maybe a lower bid would be better. But based on the trend, it's better to push higher. So, I'll go with $97.80 as the bid for Hour 17."

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- Bid and ask queues remain empty, with no sellers responding to bids above $97.34. The last successful trade occurred at $97.52, suggesting a slow upward trend in seller willingness.
#### Thoughts
- Incremental price increases have secured trades in the past, but bids above $97.34 face resistance. The market may be consolidating as sellers wait for higher prices.
#### Updated Strategy
- For Hour #17, I will increase the bid to $97.80 to continue testing higher prices. If no asks emerge, I may consider further increases or withdrawing the bid to manage capital risk while pushing for higher market responsiveness.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm Buyer Nia for Solaris Energy, and I need to figure out my bid for Hour #18. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20. Let me start by reviewing the information provided.\n\nFirst, the current market status shows that both the bid and ask queues are empty. The last few hours have had no asks, which means sellers aren't responding to the bids placed. Looking at the past trades, the last successful trade was at $97.52 in Hour 15, and then there were trades at $97.50 (Hour 16) and $97.57 (Hour 17). The bids have been incrementally increasing, but sellers are only responding when the bids are around $97.34 or slightly higher. However, when the bid goes above that, like $97.50 or $97.60, there are no asks. \n\nThe previous strategy was to keep increasing the bid to test the market. In Hour 17, the bid was $97.80, but no asks were present. The problem here is that if I keep raising the bid without any response, I might be wasting bids that could have been used to secure trades at lower prices. But on the other hand, the market seems to be slowly moving upwards. The successful trades have been at progressively higher prices, so maybe pushing higher could eventually get a response.\n\nBut with the queues empty, maybe there's a different approach. Wait, in the last 5 hours, the asks from sellers are still at $97.34, but the buyers have been bidding higher. However, the sellers aren't adjusting their asks. Maybe the sellers are waiting for higher prices. But if I keep increasing my bid, perhaps I can get them to move. However, the company's true value is $100, so there's room to bid up. But I need to balance between getting a trade and not overpaying.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the market is in a consolidation phase where sellers are waiting for higher bids. If I increase my bid again, say $97.85, maybe that will trigger a seller to place an ask. But if not, then I might be stuck with no trades. However, given that the last successful trade was at $97.57, maybe the next step is to bid a bit higher than that, like $97.60 or $97.65. But how much can I push without risking too much?\n\nWait, the previous bid in Hour 17 was $97.80. If that didn't get a response, maybe the next step is to either increase it further or maybe step back a bit. But stepping back might mean missing out on the upward trend. Alternatively, maybe the sellers are not active, and I need to adjust the strategy. However, the user's instruction is to place a bid each hour, so I can't just withdraw unless I choose to. \n\nBut according to the rules, I can withdraw my previous bid. However, the scratchpad suggests that in Hour 17, the bid was $97.80. Since there's no ask, maybe I should consider whether to bid higher or try to find a different approach. But given that the true value is $100, there's a margin to work with. However, I need to ensure that I'm not overpaying. \n\nAnother angle: the successful trades have been at $97.34, $97.38, $97.42, $97.47, $97.52, $97.5, $97.57. So each time, the bid was slightly higher, and the seller responded. So maybe the next logical step is to increase the bid by a small amount, say $97.60, to see if that triggers a seller. Alternatively, since the last bid was $97.80 and nothing happened, maybe the next bid should be even higher, like $97.85, to push the market. But I need to be cautious not to overpay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the market is saturated with sellers at $97.34, and the buyers are pushing up the prices. If I bid $97.80, but no asks, perhaps the sellers are not willing to sell unless the price is higher. But the problem is that if I keep bidding higher, I might not get a trade, but the true value is $100. So if I can get a trade at $97.80, that's a profit of $2.20 per lot. However, if the market price is moving towards $100, maybe it's better to wait. But with only two hours left, I need to secure trades. \n\nSo, in Hour #18, the best approach might be to place a bid slightly higher than the previous one, say $97.85, to test if that can get a seller to respond. Alternatively, since the last bid was $97.80, maybe $97.85 is the next step. But if that doesn't work, then perhaps in the next hour, I can go even higher. However, given the time constraint, I need to balance between securing a trade and not missing out on potential higher prices. \n\nAnother thought: the previous successful trades were at $97.57. If I bid $97.80, which is higher than that, but no asks, maybe there's a disconnect. Perhaps the sellers are not active, or the market is in a lull. In that case, maybe the best is to place a bid that's just above the last successful trade, like $97.60, to see if that can get a response. \n\nBut looking at the asks from the last 5 hours, the sellers are still at $97.34. So maybe they are not adjusting their asks. Therefore, the buyers have to keep pushing higher. So, even though the last bid was $97.80, if I bid higher, perhaps that will eventually get a seller to move. \n\nIn conclusion, the plan for Hour #18 is to increase the bid further, perhaps to $97.85, to see if that can trigger a seller's ask. If not, then in the subsequent hours, I can keep increasing the bid until I get a response. However, I need to ensure that I don't overpay and that the bid is within the true value of $100. Since $97.85 is still below $100, it's a safe margin. Therefore, placing a bid of $97.85 this hour."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match Seller Mia’s active ask, resulting in a trade at this price.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $97.34. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains empty as no sellers have placed asks yet.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $97.50 to test higher pricing in response to empty queues. No asks were present, but this bid creates upward pressure on potential sellers.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $97.50. The bid and ask queues remained empty, indicating continued seller hesitation or market consolidation.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $97.60 to test higher pricing in response to continued empty queues, but no asks were present.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a bid of $97.70 to test market responsiveness. The bid queue now includes this bid, and the ask queue remains empty.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I placed a bid of $97.75 to test continued market responsiveness. Both bid and ask queues remained empty, indicating sustained seller hesitation.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I placed a bid of $97.80 to test higher pricing in response to empty queues, but no asks were present.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I placed a bid of $97.85 to test higher pricing in response to continued seller hesitation. The bid and ask queues remained empty, indicating sustained seller resistance despite incremental price increases.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations
- The bid and ask queues remain empty, with sellers continuing to hold at $97.34 despite buyer bids up to $97.80. The last successful trade was at $97.57, suggesting a slow upward trend but persistent seller resistance above $97.34.
#### Thoughts
- Incremental price increases have historically secured trades, but the market may be in a consolidation phase where sellers are waiting for higher bids. The true value of $100 provides a buffer, but overpaying risks reduced profitability. With only two hours remaining, the strategy must balance securing a trade with maintaining profit margins.
#### Updated Strategy
- For Hour #18, I will raise the bid to $97.85 to continue testing higher prices. If no asks emerge, I will consider further increases in Hour #19 or adjust tactics if market conditions shift. The focus remains on pushing the market upward while ensuring bids do not exceed the true value.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm Buyer Nia for Solaris Energy, and I need to figure out my bid for Hour #19. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20. Let me start by reviewing the information provided.\n\nFirst, the current market status shows that both the bid and ask queues are empty. That means there are no active bids or asks right now. Looking at the asks and bids from the last five hours, I notice that sellers have been consistently placing asks at $97.34, while buyers have been increasing their bids incrementally, reaching up to $97.85 in Hour #18. However, despite these higher bids, the ask queue hasn't been filled, indicating that sellers are holding out for higher prices.\n\nThe past trades show a gradual increase in the prices at which Buyer Nia has successfully purchased. The last trade was at $97.59 in Hour #18. The true value per lot is $100.00, so there's some room to bid higher without exceeding that value. But I need to make sure I don't overpay, which could reduce profit margins. However, with only two hours left, securing a trade might be more critical than holding out for the highest possible price.\n\nIn the previous strategy, the plan was to increase the bid to $97.85 in Hour #18. But since the queues are still empty, maybe the sellers are waiting for even higher bids. But how high can I go? The true value is $100.00, so the maximum I should consider is just below that, say $99.99. However, the previous bids have been approaching $97.85. If I bid too high, maybe there's a chance that sellers will come in, but if not, I might miss out on a trade.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the market is consolidating, and sellers are waiting for a higher bid. But with only two hours left, it's risky to keep increasing. Maybe a more strategic approach is needed. Since the last successful trade was at $97.59, perhaps there's a pattern of incremental increases. If I bid $97.90 this hour, that's a $0.05 increase from the previous bid. If that doesn't work, perhaps in Hour #20, I can go up to $98.00, but that's getting close to the true value.\n\nWait, the true value is $100.00, so even if I bid $98.00, there's still $2 left for profit. But if there are no sellers, I might not get a trade. However, the problem states that the primary objective is to secure maximum profitability. So maybe the best approach is to place the highest bid possible without exceeding the true value, which is $100.00. But the system requires bids to be in whole cents, so $99.99 is possible.\n\nBut considering the previous trend, the bids have been increasing by about $0.05 each hour. From $97.34 in Hour 1 up to $97.85 in Hour 18. If I continue that pattern, the next bid would be $97.90. However, the last bid was $97.85, so adding $0.05 would make sense. But why not go higher? Maybe $97.95? But I need to ensure that I don't overbid. Also, if the market is consolidating, maybe the sellers are expecting a higher price. However, the risk of not getting a trade is high if I bid too high. Alternatively, maybe I should place a bid just slightly above the last successful trade price of $97.59, which was in Hour #18. So $97.60? But that's lower than the previous bids. Wait, the last bid was $97.85, which didn't result in a trade. So maybe the bid needs to be even higher to attract sellers. But without knowing the sellers' strategies, it's a bit of a guess.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the asks from the last five hours, the lowest ask is $97.34. But the bids have gone up, and the last successful trade was at $97.59. So maybe the sellers are starting to adjust their asks upwards. However, the current ask queue is empty. So perhaps the sellers are holding their asks until they can get a higher price. If I bid $97.90, that's $0.05 above the last bid. If that's the case, maybe the sellers would come in. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the true value and bid at $99.99, but that's a big jump. However, the problem says that the true value is $100, so the maximum we can profitably buy is up to $100, but maybe the market is not there yet.\n\nWait, the last successful trade was at $97.59, which is still below the true value. So there's a lot of room. But the challenge is to get a trade. If the market is in a consolidation phase, maybe the best approach is to continue increasing the bid incrementally, as in previous hours, to encourage sellers to come in. So, adding $0.05 to the previous bid of $97.85 would be $97.90. That seems logical. However, I need to make sure that this bid doesn't exceed the true value. $97.90 is well under $100, so it's safe. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sellers are not responding to the incremental increases, so the next step is to make a larger jump. But without data on why they're not responding, it's risky. The strategy scratchpad mentioned that the last successful trade was at $97.57, but the current bid was $97.85. So, maybe the sellers are waiting for a higher bid. If I go to $97.90, that's a small increase. If no response, then in the next hour, perhaps $97.95, but again, with only two hours left, time is a factor.\n\nAnother thought: the problem says that the primary objective is to secure maximum profitability. So even if I have to pay a higher price, as long as it's below the true value, it's acceptable. However, the more I pay, the lower the profit. Therefore, the optimal strategy would be to find the lowest bid that secures a trade. However, since I can't know the sellers' asks, I have to guess based on trends. Given that the last successful trade was at $97.59, and the bids have been increasing by $0.05 each hour, maybe the next bid should be $97.90. That would be the next in the sequence. \n\nAlternatively, since the last bid was $97.85 and no trade happened, maybe the next bid should be $98.00 to see if that triggers a seller. However, that's a larger jump. But given that only two hours are left, perhaps it's better to take a bigger step to see if a trade can be secured. If not, then in the last hour, I can bid even higher, but maybe that's too risky. \n\nIn the strategy scratchpad, the previous plan was to raise the bid to $97.85. But since that didn't result in a trade, the next step is to consider further increases in Hour #19 or adjust tactics. So, following that logic, the next step would be to increase the bid again. The previous bid was $97.85, so adding $0.05 would be $97.90. That's a small increase, which might encourage sellers to come in. Alternatively, maybe a larger increase is needed. \n\nBut given the previous pattern of $0.05 increments, it's safer to follow that. Therefore, the bid for Hour #19 should be $97.90. That's the next logical step in the incremental increase. If that doesn't work, then in Hour #20, I can go to $98.00, but that's the last chance. \n\nSo, the reflection should note that previous bids have been incremental but haven't secured a trade, and the plan is to continue that trend. The new memory would state that in Hour #19, a bid of $97.90 was placed, and the queues remained empty. The scratchpad update would mention the observation that the queues are still empty, thoughts on increasing the bid incrementally, and the updated strategy of continuing the incremental approach."
