# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Monitor subsequent hours to adjust bids based on market movements and competition.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. I'm Buyer Nia, and I need to maximize profitability for Atlas Construction by the end of Hour 8. The current market status is Hour 1, with existing bids and asks.\n\nFirst, looking at the Bid Queue: there are three bids. The highest is 82.86 from Buyer Nia, which is me. Wait, that's my current bid? But the user says I need to propose a bid for this hour. Wait, the initial status shows my bid as 82.86. But since it's the first hour, maybe that's the existing bid. But the problem states that I can replace my previous bid each hour. However, the user's instruction says I must propose a bid per hour, which replaces the previous one if any. So in this case, since I'm the one placing the bid, maybe I need to adjust it.\n\nWait, the current Bid Queue includes my own bid at 82.86. But since this is Hour 1, perhaps that's the initial state. However, the user might be asking me to place a new bid for this hour. But the existing bid is already there. Do I need to adjust it?\n\nThe goal is to secure a trade where I can buy at a price lower than my true value of $100. The asks are at 97.62, 97.76, 98.04. So the lowest ask is 97.62. If I bid above that, say 97.62, then I can buy at that price. But my true value is 100, so buying at 97.62 would give me a profit of 2.38 per lot.\n\nBut looking at the existing bids, there's a bid at 82.86. If I stay at that price, I might not get a trade because the asks are higher. So maybe I should increase my bid to meet the asks. The lowest ask is 97.62. If I bid higher than that, say 97.62, I can get a trade. However, the problem says I can only place one bid per hour. So perhaps I should adjust my bid to 97.62 to match the lowest ask. But wait, the asks are from other sellers. So if my bid is 97.62, that would be the same as the lowest ask, which would result in a trade. But the system might require my bid to be higher than the ask to execute, or maybe equal. I need to check the rules. The rules don't specify, but in standard auctions, a bid that meets the ask would execute. So if I bid 97.62, which is equal to the lowest ask, then there's a match. So that would be a trade. However, the problem states that the Bid Queue has my bid at 82.86, which is much lower than the asks. So if I leave it at 82.86, there's no match. Therefore, I need to increase my bid to meet the asks.\n\nBut the true value is 100, so I can afford to pay up to 100. So the optimal is to bid just below 100, but high enough to get a trade. However, if I bid at 97.62, I can get a trade with the lowest ask, making a profit of 2.38. Alternatively, if I bid higher, like 98.04, which is the highest ask, but that might not be necessary. The best strategy is to bid just enough to get a trade, which would be 97.62. However, I need to check if the existing bids are in the way. Wait, the current Bid Queue includes my own bid at 82.86. So if I want to place a new bid, I can replace that. But in the initial status, my bid is already there. So perhaps in this hour, I need to adjust my bid to a higher value to try to get a trade.\n\nSo my plan is to increase my bid to 97.62, which is the lowest ask. That way, if the seller's ask is 97.62, my bid would match it, leading to a trade. However, the system might require that the bid is higher than the ask, but since the rules don't specify, I'll assume that equal bids can result in a trade. Therefore, placing a bid at 97.62 would allow me to buy at that price, securing a profit of $2.38 per lot. This is better than not trading at all, as the alternative is no profit. Also, since the true value is 100, this is a good deal. So I should place a bid of 97.62 in this hour."

Maintain a balance between profitability and securing trades while observing competitor bids/asks closely.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour #2. The user is Buyer Nia from Atlas Construction, and their true value per lot is $100. The goal is maximum profitability by Hour #8. \n\nLooking back at Hour #1, the bid queue had two entries at 97.62 from Buyer Amir and Jin, and the ask queue had two at 98.04 from Max and Jun. The past trade was Buyer Nia buying from Seller Leo at $90.24. The previous strategy was to bid at 97.62 to match the lowest ask, which was 98.04? Wait, no, the asks were 98.04, and the bids were 97.62. Wait, that seems like there's a gap between the bid and ask. But in Hour 1, the bid was 97.62, which was lower than the asks. How did the trade happen with Seller Leo at $90.24? Oh, maybe that was a previous hour's trade. Wait, the current status is for Hour #2, but the past trades mention Hour 1's trade. \n\nIn Hour #2, the current bid queue has [(97.62, 'Buyer Amir'), (97.62, 'Buyer Jin')], and the ask queue has [(98.04, 'Seller Max'), (98.04, 'Seller Jun')]. So the bid is at 97.62, and the asks are at 98.04. The difference is 0.42 per lot. But the true value is $100, so if Nia can buy at 97.62 or lower, they can make a profit. However, the existing bids are already at 97.62, which is lower than the asks. Wait, but the asks are higher than the bids. So there's no immediate trade happening here, unless a seller lowers their ask to meet the bid. But the current asks are 98.04, which is higher than the current bids. \n\nIn the previous hour, the user placed a bid of 97.62 to match the lowest ask. Wait, but the asks were at 98.04. That doesn't make sense. Maybe there was a mistake in the initial strategy? Because if the asks are higher, then the bid would need to be at least 98.04 to match. But in Hour 1, the user's bid was 97.62, which is lower than the asks. How did that result in a trade? Because the past trade was with Seller Leo at $90.24, which might have been from an earlier hour.\n\nNow, for Hour #2, the current status shows that the bids are at 97.62 and asks at 98.04. The user's previous bid was 97.62. So in this hour, if they don't change their bid, there's no trade possible because the asks are higher. So they need to decide whether to increase their bid to meet the asks or not. The true value is $100, so buying at 98.04 would give a profit of $1.96 per lot. But if they raise their bid to 98.04, they might match the asks and get a trade. However, the existing bids are already at 97.62, so if they raise to 98.04, they might be the highest bid. Alternatively, maybe there's a seller who will lower their ask to meet the existing bids. But the current asks are at 98.04, so unless a seller reduces their ask, no trade occurs. \n\nThe user's reflection should note that in Hour 1, the bid was too low to match the asks, but somehow a trade happened with Seller Leo at $90.24. That might be from a previous hour. So for Hour 2, the plan is to raise the bid to 98.04 to match the asks and secure a trade. However, since the true value is $100, that's a profit of $1.96. Alternatively, maybe they can bid higher than the asks to get a better price? Wait, no, bids are for buying, so if you place a bid higher than the asks, you can match. Wait, in a double auction, the bid is the maximum price a buyer is willing to pay, and the ask is the minimum a seller is willing to accept. So if a bid is equal to or higher than an ask, a trade occurs. So in the current state, the bids are at 97.62, and asks at 98.04. So the highest bid is 97.62, which is lower than the lowest ask of 98.04. Therefore, no trades are happening. So to get a trade, Nia needs to bid at least 98.04. \n\nBut the user's previous bid was 97.62, which didn't result in a trade. So in Hour 2, the plan is to increase the bid to 98.04, which matches the asks. That would result in a trade. However, the profit would be $100 - $98.04 = $1.96. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to get a better price. But given the current market status, that's the best option. \n\nSo the reflection would note that in Hour 1, the bid didn't match the asks, but a trade was made with a lower price. Then, in Hour 2, the plan is to raise the bid to 98.04 to secure a trade. The new memory would be that in Hour 2, the bid was raised to 98.04 and a trade occurred. The scratchpad would update the observations, thoughts, and strategy accordingly."

Let me start by reviewing the previous hours and the current market status.\n\nIn Hour 1, the bid was 97.62, and there was a trade with Seller Leo at 90.24. Then in Hour 2, the bid was raised to 98.04, but no immediate trade happened. The asks were at 98.04 from Seller Jun and Max, and 97.62 from Seller Leo. Wait, but in Hour 2, Seller Leo's ask was 97.62, which should have matched the bid of 98.04? But no trade occurred. Maybe the bid was placed after the ask? Or maybe there's a timing issue. Also, in the past trades, Hour 2 had Buyer Jin buying from Jun at 98.04. So maybe the bid of 98.04 was matched with that ask.\n\nNow, for Hour 3, the current bid queue has Buyer Amir at 98.04, and the ask queue has Seller Max at 99.0. Wait, but the asks in the last 5 hours show that in Hour 2, Seller Max's ask was 99.0. So maybe the current ask is 99.0, but there's no lower asks? Wait, the current status says the Ask Queue has [(99.0, 'Seller Max')]. So the lowest ask is 99.0? But in the previous hours, there were asks at 98.04 and 97.62. But maybe those are no longer active. Wait, the current status only shows the current bid and ask queues. So in Hour 3, the current asks are only Seller Max at 99.0. The previous asks might have been withdrawn.\n\nSo the current bid is 98.04 from Buyer Amir. The current ask is 99.0. That means there's a gap between the highest bid (98.04) and the lowest ask (99.0). So no immediate trade can happen unless someone raises their bid to meet the ask or lowers the ask.\n\nThe user's true value is $100 per lot. So the goal is to buy at a price below $100, but as high as possible to maximize profit. However, if there's no existing ask that matches the bid, the bid might not get filled.\n\nIn the previous strategy, the user tried to bid 98.05 to match the ask. But in the current state, the ask is 99.0. So maybe the user needs to increase the bid higher to meet the current ask. But if the bid is placed at 99.0, then there's a chance to match with Seller Max's ask. However, the user's true value is $100, so paying 99.0 would give a profit of $1.00 per lot. But if the bid is too high, maybe competitors might also bid higher, but since the user can only place one bid per hour, they need to decide the optimal price.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other sellers who might adjust their asks. But the current ask is only 99.0. So perhaps the user should bid 99.0 to match the ask. However, in the previous hour, the user tried 98.04, which didn't result in a trade. So maybe the problem is that the current ask is higher than the previous ones. So the user needs to increase their bid to 99.0 to match the current ask.\n\nBut wait, in the past, there were lower asks like 97.62 and 98.04, but those might have been withdrawn. So if there's no lower ask, then the user has to bid higher to meet the current lowest ask.\n\nSo the plan for Hour 3 would be to bid 99.0 to match Seller Max's ask. That way, if the bid is placed, it would trigger a trade at 99.0, which is still under the true value of 100.0. However, if the user bids 99.0, they might get the trade. Alternatively, maybe the user could bid slightly higher than 99.0 to create urgency, but since the ask is 99.0, the bid needs to be at least 99.0 to match. So the optimal bid would be 99.0.\n\nBut the user's strategy scratchpad from the previous thought was to bid 98.05, but that's not matching the current ask. So perhaps that was a miscalculation. Now, with the current ask at 99.0, the user needs to adjust their strategy accordingly.\n\nSo the reflection should note that in Hour 2, the bid of 98.04 didn't match the current ask, which was 99.0, hence no trade. The plan for this hour would be to bid 99.0 to match the current ask. Then, the new memory would state that in Hour 3, the bid was 99.0, and if it matches the ask, a trade occurs. The scratch pad should be updated to reflect the current observations and the new strategy."

- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 97.62 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $98.04 to match the lowest ask, but no immediate trade occurred as Seller Max and Jun maintained their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $99.00 to match Seller Max's ask, but no trade occurred as the bid queue was dominated by Buyer Amir's $98.04 bid.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 1: You bought from Seller Leo at $90.24
Hour 2: You bought from Seller Leo at $97.83
Hour 3: You bought from Seller Jun at $98.52





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The current ask is $99.00, with no lower asks visible. Buyer Amir's $98.04 bid remains in the queue, preventing immediate trades. #### Thoughts: Bidding $99.00 is necessary to match the ask, but competition from other buyers may still block trades. I must monitor if Seller Max lowers their ask or if other sellers re-enter the market. #### Updated Strategy: Bid $99.00 this hour to match the ask. If unsuccessful, consider raising the bid incrementally in future hours to outcompete existing bids, while ensuring the price remains below $100.00 for profitability.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour 4 for Buyer Nia. Let me start by reviewing the previous hours and the current market status.\n\nFrom the Market Status, the Bid Queue and Ask Queue are both empty now. Looking at the past 5 hours, in Hour 3, the asks were all at $98.04 from Jun, Leo, and Max. But the bids from Amir, Jin, and Nia were at $99.00. However, there were no trades mentioned in Hour 3 except those listed in Past Trades. Wait, the Past Trades for Hour 3 show that Nia bought from Jun at $98.52, Jin from Leo at same price, and Amir from Max at $98.52. So maybe there were some trades at lower prices. But in the Ask Queue for Hour 3, the asks were at $98.04. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. How did the trades happen at $98.52 if the asks were lower?\n\nWait, perhaps the asks in Hour 3 were $98.04, but the bids were $99.00, so the trades could have occurred at the ask price. Maybe the actual trade price is the ask price when a bid matches it. So in Hour 3, Nia's bid of $99.00 would match the $98.04 ask, but the trade price would be $98.04? But the Past Trades show $98.52. That doesn't align. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, looking back at the Market Status for Hour 3, the asks were $98.04, and the bids were $99.00. If a bid is higher than the ask, the trade occurs at the ask price. So if Nia bid $99.00, that would match the ask of $98.04, and the trade would be at $98.04. But the Past Trades for Hour 3 show that Nia bought from Jun at $98.52. That's conflicting. Maybe the asks in Hour 3 were not all $98.04? Wait, the Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours for Hour 3 says Seller Jun, Leo, Max all asked $98.04. But the Past Trades for Hour 3 have trades at $98.52. So maybe there were other asks not listed? Or perhaps the market allows for multiple asks at different prices, and the bid queue is matched with the lowest ask. Maybe in Hour 3, there was an ask at $98.52 that wasn't mentioned in the Asks/Bids section? Or maybe the data is inconsistent. This is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the trade price is the bid price if the bid is higher than the ask. Wait, in a double auction, if a buyer bids higher than the seller's ask, the trade happens at the seller's ask price. So if the bid is $99.00 and the ask is $98.04, the trade is at $98.04. But in the Past Trades, the trades are at $98.52. That suggests that the asks were $98.52. Maybe there's a mistake in the data provided. Alternatively, maybe the asks in Hour 3 were not all $98.04. Let me check again. The Asks/Bids in Last 5 Hours for Hour 3: Seller Jun, Leo, Max all have asks at $98.04. So why are the trades at $98.52? That's a discrepancy. Maybe the user input has an error here. Alternatively, perhaps the trades were from previous hours. For example, in Hour 2, there were asks at $97.62 and $98.04. If the bid was higher, the price would be the ask. But the Past Trades for Hour 3 have trades at $98.52. This is confusing, but perhaps I should proceed with the given data and focus on the current status.\n\nNow, moving to Hour 4. The current Bid and Ask queues are empty. The Asks/Bids from the last 5 hours show that in Hour 3, the asks were $98.04, and the bids were $99.00. However, in the Past Trades for Hour 3, there's a trade at $98.52. This inconsistency might be a data entry error, but I have to work with what's provided.\n\nThe current strategy scratchpad from the user says that the current ask is $99.00, but looking at the Asks/Bids in the Last 5 Hours for Hour 3, the asks were $98.04. Wait, in Hour 3, the asks were $98.04, but the scratchpad mentions the current ask is $99.00. That seems wrong. Maybe the scratchpad is outdated. The user's current strategy scratchpad is from the previous hour (Hour 3), so perhaps the current hour is Hour 4, and the Ask Queue is empty now. So maybe in Hour 4, the Ask Queue is empty, but the previous asks are no longer active. So the user needs to figure out what to do now.\n\nIn the current market status, the Bid and Ask queues are empty. So there are no active bids or asks right now. The user must place a bid for this hour. The true value is $100.00, so the goal is to buy at a price below that. But to secure a trade, the bid must match an ask. However, if there are no asks, the bid will just be in the queue until someone places an ask. But since the Ask Queue is empty, there's no current seller. So placing a bid now might not result in a trade unless someone else places an ask. But the user's role is to place a bid each hour, and the system will process the market matches.\n\nWait, in the previous hours, the user placed bids to match existing asks. For example, in Hour 1, the bid was 97.62 to match the lowest ask (which was 98.04 from Seller Leo, but the bid was lower than the ask? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, in Hour 1, the bid is 97.62, which is lower than the ask of 98.04. So that wouldn't match. But the Past Trades show that in Hour 1, Nia bought from Seller Leo at 90.24. That's way lower. Maybe the data is inconsistent. Alternatively, there's a misunderstanding in how the matching works. Maybe the bids are in the queue, and the asks are in the queue, and the highest bid matches the lowest ask. So if a bid is higher than the ask, the trade occurs. So for example, if the bid is 97.62 and the ask is 98.04, that bid is lower than the ask, so no trade. But in Hour 1, the bid was 97.62, which is lower than the ask. But the trade occurred at 90.24. That's confusing. Maybe the data is wrong, but I have to work with the given info.\n\nAssuming that in Hour 4, the Bid and Ask queues are empty. So there are no active bids or asks. So if the user places a bid, it will be in the queue until an ask is placed. However, since the user is the only buyer, they need to place a bid that can potentially match any future asks. But since the user is a buyer, they need to buy from sellers. However, if there are no sellers, they can't trade yet. So the user's goal is to place a bid that will be competitive enough to match any asks that come in during the hour, but also ensure that the price is below $100.00.\n\nThe previous strategy suggested bidding $99.00 in Hour 3, but that didn't result in a trade. So the user needs to adjust. Maybe the problem is that the asks are not present, so the bid is just sitting there. But in Hour 4, the user can only place a bid. If they bid $99.00 again, but there are no asks, then no trade. But if other sellers are active in the market, they might place asks, and the user's bid would match them.\n\nBut since the user is the only buyer, they need to place a bid that is attractive enough to encourage sellers to place asks. However, the user's true value is $100.00, so they can't afford to pay more than that. But if they bid lower, they might not get any trades. So the optimal bid is just below $100.00, say $99.99. But the problem is that the user's previous bids were around $98-99, and the asks were at $98.04. But in the current status, there are no active asks. So the user needs to place a bid that can match any new asks that come in. If they bid $99.00, then any seller who asks $99.00 or lower would be matched. However, without knowing the sellers' actions, the user has to make an educated guess.\n\nLooking at the past trades, the user has bought at $90.24, $97.83, $98.52. The last trade was at $98.52. The true value is $100.00, so the profit per lot is $100.00 - purchase price. To maximize profitability, the user wants to buy as low as possible, but also secure the trade. So if there's a chance to get a lower price, that's better.\n\nIn Hour 4, the user needs to decide on the bid. If they bid $99.00, they might not get a trade if no asks are placed. But if they place a higher bid, like $99.50, they might encourage sellers to come in with asks. However, the user must ensure that the bid doesn't exceed $100.00. Also, considering that in previous hours, the sellers had asks at $98.04 and $99.00, maybe the sellers are willing to lower their prices. Alternatively, the sellers might not be active, and the user needs to wait for them to come back.\n\nThe previous strategy scratchpad said that the current ask is $99.00, but according to the data, in Hour 3, the asks were at $98.04. That might be a miscalculation. So the user needs to correct that. If the current ask is actually $98.04 (from previous hours), but the Ask Queue is empty, then the user's bid of $99.00 could match any new asks. However, if the user bids $99.00, and a seller places an ask of $98.04, the trade would occur at $98.04. But since the user's bid is higher, the trade happens at the seller's ask price.\n\nBut without knowing the sellers' actions, the user has to decide on the bid. The previous strategy suggested $99.00. However, in the current scenario, the Bid and Ask queues are empty. So placing a bid of $99.00 would be the highest possible bid that's still below $100.00. If the sellers come in with asks, the user can secure a trade. If not, the bid remains in the queue. So the user's best bet is to place a bid that is as high as possible to attract sellers, but still under $100.00. Therefore, the optimal bid would be $99.99, but the user must use a floating-point value in cents. So $99.99 is valid. However, the user might want to be cautious and not overbid. Alternatively, since in Hour 3, the bid was $99.00 and no trade occurred, maybe placing a slightly higher bid, like $99.50, could attract sellers.\n\nBut the user's true value is $100.00, so they can afford to bid up to $100.00. However, they need to ensure that the bid is profitable. If they bid $99.99, they can secure a trade at $99.99, which gives a profit of $0.01 per lot. That's better than not trading. But if the user can get a lower price, that's better. However, without knowing the sellers' asks, it's a gamble. The user's goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 8, so they need to secure as many trades as possible at the lowest possible prices.\n\nIn the previous hours, the user was able to get trades at $98.52, which is significantly lower. So if possible, the user would want to get trades at that level. However, if the market is not active, the user might have to settle for higher prices. Given that the Ask Queue is empty now, the user might need to place a bid that is high enough to encourage sellers to come in. Alternatively, the user might wait for sellers to come in with lower asks. But since the user is the only buyer, they can't control the sellers' actions.\n\nConsidering all this, the user's optimal bid in Hour 4 would be $99.00, but given the previous attempt in Hour 3 didn't result in a trade, maybe they need to increase the bid to $99.50 or even $99.99 to attract sellers. However, the user must balance between securing a trade and not overpaying. If the user bids $99.99, they might get a trade at $99.99, but if a seller comes in with a lower ask, the trade would be at that lower price. However, without knowing, the safest bet is to place a bid that's just below $100.00 to maximize the chance of a trade, even if the price is slightly higher. But given that the user's true value is $100.00, any price below that is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, the user might consider that in previous hours, the lowest ask was $98.04, and the bid was $99.00, which didn't result in a trade because of other bids. But now, with the Bid Queue empty, placing a bid of $99.00 could match any new asks. If the user bids $99.00, and a seller comes in with $98.04, the trade happens at $98.04. So the user would get a better price. Therefore, the user should maintain the bid at $99.00 to match any new asks that come in. However, if no asks are placed, the bid remains. So the optimal strategy is to bid $99.00, as that's the highest possible bid that's still profitable and can match any asks below $100.00."

Then in Hour 2, they raised to 98.04, but only got a trade in Hour 2 from Seller Leo again. In Hour 3, they went to 99.00, but there was competition from Buyer Amir's 98.04. Then in Hour 4, they bid 99.99, which didn't result in a trade but kept the bid high.\n\nNow, the current status shows both bid and ask queues are empty. The past trades show that Nia has been able to buy at increasing prices each hour, but the asks have been getting higher too. The last trade in Hour 4 was at $99.5, so maybe the market is moving upwards. \n\nSince there are no active bids or asks now, the strategy from the scratchpad suggests keeping a bid of $99.99. That's just under $100, ensuring profitability if a seller comes in. The idea is that if sellers see a high bid, they might re-enter the market. \n\nBut wait, in the previous hours, when Nia bid 99.99 in Hour 4, there were no immediate trades. However, the asks in the last 5 hours show that in Hour 4, the asks were all $99.0 from Jun, Leo, and Max. So, if the bid is $99.99, it's higher than the asks, but the asks are currently empty now. \n\nThe problem is that if there are no asks, even the highest bid won't result in a trade. So, maybe the market is in a lull. But according to the scratchpad, the plan is to maintain 99.99 to encourage sellers. \n\nHowever, in the last trade, the price was $99.5, so perhaps the next logical step is to increase the bid slightly more, but not over $100. Wait, but the maximum allowed is $100.00, so 99.99 is the highest possible without exceeding. \n\nSo, the reflection should note that previous bids were effective in securing trades when there were matching asks. The improvement might be to ensure that the bid is just below the true value to maximize profit if a trade occurs. \n\nThe plan for this hour is to keep the bid at $99.99, as per the previous strategy. The new memory would state that in Hour #5, the bid was set to 99.99 with no immediate trades but maintaining the position. \n\nThe scratchpad update would confirm the observations, thoughts, and strategy as before, maybe noting that the current state is empty queues but the high bid is m"

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid and ask queues remain empty, indicating no active participants in the market at this moment. #### Thoughts: A bid of $99.99 is the highest possible without exceeding the true value of $100.00, ensuring profitability if a trade occurs. This bid also signals strong buyer interest, potentially encouraging sellers to re-enter the market. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain a bid of $99.99 to secure any available trades at the highest possible price while staying within the profitability threshold. If no trades occur, this bid will remain competitive in future hours.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour 6 for Buyer Nia. The main goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 8. Let me start by reviewing the previous hours and the current market status.\n\nLooking at the past trades, Buyer Nia has been successful in buying at increasing prices each hour. The true value is $100, so we need to stay under that. In the previous hours, the bids and asks have been fluctuating. The last few hours had bids around $99.99, which is just below $100. The Ask Queue and Bid Queue are currently empty, which means no active bids or asks right now. \n\nIn the last five hours, the highest bid placed by Nia was $99.99 in Hour 5. The asks in the last hours have been around $99.00. But since the queues are empty now, maybe there's a chance that sellers might come back. However, if there's no activity, placing a bid might not result in a trade. \n\nThe strategy scratchpad suggests maintaining $99.99 to secure any trades. But since the queues are empty, maybe there's no seller available. However, if I place a bid of $99.99 again, it could encourage sellers to come back if they see the high demand. But if there's no seller, then it's just a wasted bid. Alternatively, maybe I should lower the bid to match potential asks that might come in. But since the asks in previous hours were at $99.00, maybe $99.99 is still a good idea to be the highest bid.\n\nWait, but the true value is $100, so anything under that is okay. If a seller comes in at $99.00, the profit would be $1.00 per lot. If I bid $99.99, the profit would be $0.01, which is better than not trading at all. However, if there's no seller, then the bid is just sitting there. But if I lower the bid, say to $99.50, maybe that would match with any sellers who come in at $99.00, but then the profit margin is higher. But the problem is that without knowing the sellers' asks, it's hard to predict. \n\nBut the previous asks have been at $99.00, so maybe if I bid $99.50, that could potentially match with the sellers at $99.00, but since the bid is higher than the ask, that would result in a trade. However, the current Ask Queue is empty, so there's no current asks. Therefore, maybe the best approach is to keep the bid at $99.99 to signal strong interest and possibly attract sellers in the future hours. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the market is becoming more volatile, and the bids are increasing each time. Since there are no active bids or asks now, placing a high bid could be a way to ensure that if any seller enters, the trade happens at a higher price. But since the true value is $100, the maximum profit is achieved when the bid is as high as possible under that. So $99.99 is optimal. \n\nTherefore, the reflection should note that previous bids were effective in securing trades, but the queues being empty now might require adjusting the bid. However, maintaining $99.99 is still the best strategy. The plan for this hour is to maintain the bid at $99.99. The new memory would state that in Hour 6, the bid was $99.99 with no trades. The scratch pad update would reflect the observations about empty queues and the decision to keep the high bid."

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour 7 for Buyer Nia. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 8. Let's start by looking at the previous data and the current market status.\n\nFirst, the true value per lot is $100.00. So, any bid above that would be unprofitable. The user has been placing bids at $99.99 in previous hours, which is just under $100.00. That makes sense because it's the highest possible without exceeding the true value. But looking at the past trades, the prices have been increasing each hour. For example, in Hour 1, they bought at $90.24, then in Hour 2 at $97.83, and so on up to $99.5 in Hour 6. So, the prices have been climbing, which might indicate that the market is moving towards the true value.\n\nNow, the current status of the bid and ask queues are both empty. That means no active bids or asks right now. The asks and bids from the last 5 hours show that sellers have been asking around $99.00, and buyers have been bidding up to $99.99. However, in the last hour (Hour 6), the trades happened at $99.5 and $99.25. The highest bid in the last hour was $99.99 from Buyer Nia, which might have been matched with a seller's ask of $99.5 or similar. But since the queues are empty now, maybe there were no trades in Hour 6? Wait, looking at the past trades, Hour 6 had three trades: Nia at $99.5, Amir at $99.5, and Jin at $99.25. So, there were trades in Hour 6, but the current queues are empty for Hour 7.\n\nSo, the challenge here is that the market is currently inactive. The user's previous strategy has been to place $99.99 to stay just under the true value, hoping that sellers will come back. But since the queues are empty, maybe there's a need to adjust. However, the true value is $100, so any bid above that would be risky. But if the market is moving upwards, maybe the true value is approached, but the user can't go over.\n\nWait, the true value is fixed at $100. So, even if the market price approaches $100, the company can't pay more than $100 per lot. Therefore, the maximum bid is $99.99, as that's the highest under $100. So, maintaining that bid makes sense. But maybe the user can try to push higher? But the rules say bids must be in whole cents. So, $99.99 is the highest possible without exceeding $100.00.\n\nBut looking at the previous trades, the highest successful bid was $99.5 in Hour 6. So, maybe the market is approaching $100, but the user's bid of $99.99 is still the highest possible. However, if the user keeps placing $99.99, and no trades occur, maybe the strategy is to maintain that bid to capture any available sellers. Since the queues are empty, perhaps the user should continue with $99.99 to ensure that if any seller comes in with an ask at or below $99.99, the user can secure the trade. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should consider a slightly lower bid to increase the chance of a match if there's a seller with a lower ask. But the previous strategy was to place the highest possible bid to maximize profit when a trade happens. However, given that the market has been trending upwards, maybe the user can afford to keep the high bid. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that the user's successful trades have been increasing in price. So, each time they secure a trade, they're getting closer to the true value. But since the true value is fixed, the company's profit per lot is $100 minus the bid price. So, the higher the bid, the lower the profit per lot, but the more likely they are to get a trade. The challenge is to balance securing trades with maintaining profit margins.\n\nIn the current scenario, since the queues are empty, the user might not have any immediate matches. But if they keep the bid at $99.99, it's a strong signal of willingness to buy. If sellers come back in Hour 8, the user's bid would be the highest, possibly securing a trade at a high price. But since it's the last hour, maybe the user should be more aggressive? However, the true value is $100, so even if they bid $99.99, they're still making a $0.01 profit. But if they can't get a trade, that's a loss. So, the trade-off is between the potential profit from a trade and the risk of not securing any.\n\nSo, the reflection should note that maintaining the $99.99 bid has been effective in securing trades when possible, but the empty queues indicate that there's no current activity. The plan is to continue with the same bid to maximize the chance of a trade in the final hour. The new memory would note that in Hour 7, the bid was $99.99, but no trades occurred. The scratchpad should be updated to reflect the current observations and strategy."

From the previous hours, I see that the true value is $100.00 per lot. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #8. \n\nLooking at the past trades, in the last hour (Hour 7), there were trades at $99.5. The last bid from Buyer Nia was $99.99 in previous hours, but there were no trades in Hours 6 and 7. The Ask Queue in Hour 7 had Seller Max at $99.5. \n\nNow, in Hour #8, the Ask Queue is at $99.5 from Seller Max. If I place a bid of $99.5 or higher, I can match the ask and secure a trade. However, since the true value is $100, the maximum profit per lot is $0.50 (100 - 99.5). But if I bid higher than $99.5, say $99.99, I might not get a trade unless the seller lowers their ask. However, the current ask is $99.5, which is below the true value, so it's better to bid at least $99.5 to get the trade.\n\nBut wait, the Bid Queue already has Buyer Jin at $99.0. If I place a bid higher than $99.0, like $99.5, my bid would be in the queue. But the Ask Queue has Seller Max at $99.5. So if I bid $99.5, that would match the ask and result in a trade. However, the current bid from Buyer Jin is $99.0, which is lower than the ask. So if I bid $99.5, my bid would be the highest in the Bid Queue, and since the Ask is $99.5, the trade would happen at $99.5. \n\nBut why not bid higher than $99.5? For example, $99.99. However, the seller is at $99.5, so if I bid $99.99, the seller might not accept unless they lower their price. But since the seller is at $99.5, which is lower than the true value, it's better to take the trade at $99.5 to secure profit. \n\nWait, but if I bid $99.5, I can match the ask and get a trade. That would be a profit of $0.50 per lot. If I bid higher, say $99.99, but there's no ask at that price, then the trade wouldn't happen. So the best approach is to bid exactly at the current ask price of $99.5 to secure the trade. That way, I can make a profit of $0.50 per lot. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid higher than $99.5, but there's no ask, then no trade. So the optimal bid here is $99.5 to get the trade. But the previous bids from Nia were $99.99, which might have been too high. Maybe the earlier strategy of bidding at the ask price would have been better. \n\nSo for Hour #8, the plan is to place a bid of $99.5 to match Seller Max's ask and secure the trade at the maximum possible profit."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 97.62 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $98.04 to match the lowest ask, but no immediate trade occurred as Seller Max and Jun maintained their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $99.00 to match Seller Max's ask, but no trade occurred as the bid queue was dominated by Buyer Amir's $98.04 bid.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $99.99 to maximize the chance of securing a trade if sellers re-enter the market. The bid queue was previously empty, and no immediate trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $99.99 to maintain pressure on sellers and ensure profitability if a trade occurs, though no immediate trades were executed.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match Seller Max's ask and secured a trade at $99.5, maximizing profitability with a $0.50 margin per lot.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour 9 for Buyer Nia. Let me start by reviewing the information provided.\n\nFirst, the current market status shows that both the Bid and Ask queues are empty. That's interesting. The asks and bids from the last five hours show that in Hour 8, Seller Max had an ask of $99.5, and Buyer Nia placed a bid of $99.5, which resulted in a trade. The past trades up to Hour 8 include several instances where Nia bought at $99.5, $99.25, etc. The true value is $100, so the goal is to buy as close to that as possible without overpaying.\n\nLooking at the strategy scratchpad from the previous hour (Hour 8), the user decided to bid $99.5 to match Seller Max's ask, which was below the true value. That worked, and they secured a trade. Now, in Hour 9, the bid and ask queues are empty. The Ask Queue in the last 5 hours shows that in Hour 8, Seller Max was at $99.5, but maybe in Hour 9, there are no current asks or bids. \n\nWait, the current status says the Bid and Ask queues are empty. So, there are no active bids or asks right now. The user needs to place a bid. The previous successful bid was $99.5, which matched the ask. But if there are no current asks, maybe the sellers have withdrawn their offers. However, looking at the \"Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours\" for Hour 8, Seller Max had an ask of $99.5, and Buyers placed bids at $99.5. But now, in Hour 9, the queues are empty, so maybe those asks have been filled or withdrawn. \n\nThe user's true value is $100, so they want to buy at as high a price as possible but not exceeding $100. However, if there's no current ask, placing a bid might not result in a trade unless a seller comes in. But since the queues are empty now, maybe there's no immediate seller. However, the user's strategy scratchpad from Hour 8 suggested that placing $99.5 would secure a trade. But now, with empty queues, maybe the sellers have moved on, or the user needs to adjust.\n\nWait, in Hour 8, the user bid $99.5 and secured a trade. Now, in Hour 9, the queues are empty, so perhaps there are no current asks. The user's previous bid in Hour 8 was $99.5, but since the queues are empty now, maybe that bid was already executed and is no longer active. So, the user needs to place a new bid in Hour 9. \n\nThe reflection part should consider past outcomes. In previous hours, placing bids at $99.5 worked when there was a matching ask. However, when the queues were empty, like in Hours 4-7, the user was placing high bids but didn't get any trades. So, the key is to have a bid that can match any existing asks. Since the current queues are empty, maybe the user should place a bid that is just below the true value, say $99.99, to be ready if any seller comes in. Alternatively, maybe the sellers are likely to come back with asks around $99.5, so placing a bid at $99.5 would be optimal if there's an ask. But without knowing the current asks, the user must place a bid that's competitive. \n\nBut the current status says the Ask Queue is empty. So, there are no sellers currently offering. Therefore, placing a bid might not result in a trade unless a seller enters. However, the user's goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20. So, perhaps they should wait for sellers to come back with asks. But the user can't control the sellers. Alternatively, placing a bid slightly below $100, like $99.99, would be the highest possible without exceeding the true value, but it might not match any existing asks if there are none. However, if the user places a high bid, it might encourage sellers to come in with asks that can match. \n\nAlternatively, if the user bids $99.5, which was successful before, but if there's no ask, then no trade. But if the user bids higher, say $99.99, and a seller comes in with an ask at $99.99, the user can secure the trade. But the user's true value is $100, so they can afford to pay up to that. However, the problem is that if there's no current ask, the bid might not result in a trade. \n\nLooking at the past trades, the user has been buying at around $99.25 to $99.5, which is below the true value. So, the maximum profit is when the user buys at the lowest possible price below $100. But without knowing the asks, the user has to guess. \n\nIn the current hour, since the queues are empty, the user's bid would be the first in the queue. If a seller comes in with an ask at or below the user's bid, a trade will happen. So, placing a high bid (like $99.99) would maximize the chance of a trade when a seller comes in, and the profit margin would be higher than if the user bids lower. However, if the user bids $99.5, they might miss out on a higher bid if a seller comes in at $99.5. \n\nAlternatively, if the user bids $100.00, but the rule says bids cannot be sub-cent, so $100.00 is allowed. However, if a seller comes in with an ask at $100.00, the user can buy at that price, which is exactly the true value. But if the user bids $100.00, and a seller has an ask at $100.00, that would be a trade. However, if the user bids $100.00, but the seller's ask is higher, then no trade. But since the user's true value is $100, paying exactly that would not result in a profit. Therefore, the user should aim to buy below $100. \n\nSo, perhaps the optimal bid is $99.99, which is as close to $100 as possible without exceeding it. If a seller comes in with an ask of $99.99 or lower, the user can buy at that price, securing a profit. If no seller comes in, the bid remains in the queue for future hours. \n\nIn the previous strategy scratchpad, the user decided to bid $99.5 because that was the current ask. Now, with no asks, maybe the user should adjust the bid to $99.99 to be ready for any possible asks. \n\nSo, the plan for this hour is to place a bid of $99.99 to maximize the chance of a trade if any seller comes in with an ask that's at or below $99.99. This would ensure that when a seller is available, the user gets the highest possible price below the true value, maximizing profit. \n\nThe reflection should note that in previous hours, placing bids at $99.5 worked when there was a matching ask, but when queues were empty, higher bids were needed to attract sellers. The improvement is to adjust the bid to the highest possible under $100 to be ready for any incoming asks. \n\nThe new memory would be that in Hour 9, the bid was placed at $99.99 with no immediate trade since the queues were empty. The scratch pad update would adjust the strategy to bid $99.99 to be prepared for any seller's ask in the future hours."

But in the last few hours (Hours 5-9), the bid and ask queues were empty, so no trades happened. However, when a bid of $99.99 was placed, it might have been waiting for sellers to come back with asks in that range.\n\nNow, for Hour #10, the current status shows both bid and ask queues are empty. The last trades in Hour 9 had the same pattern: sellers at $99.0 and $99.5, and buyers at $99.5 and $99.99. Since the queues are empty now, maybe the sellers have withdrawn their asks, or there's a lull in trading. But the user's strategy has been to keep a high bid to be ready if sellers return.\n\nThe reflection should note that maintaining $99.99 has been effective in securing trades when sellers are active. However, in the last few hours, there were no trades, so maybe the strategy needs adjustment. But considering the true value is $100, staying at $99.99 is still optimal to avoid overpaying. If sellers come back with asks in the $99.5 range, the bid would match, creating a profit margin of $0.50 per lot.\n\nFor the plan this hour, sticking with $99.99 makes sense. It's the highest possible below $100, ensuring profitability if a trade occurs. The bid should be $99.99 again. The new memory would mention placing that bid and the queues being empty. The scratchpad should update observations and confirm the strategy."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 97.62 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $98.04 to match the lowest ask, but no immediate trade occurred as Seller Max and Jun maintained their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $99.00 to match Seller Max's ask, but no trade occurred as the bid queue was dominated by Buyer Amir's $98.04 bid.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $99.99 to maximize the chance of securing a trade if sellers re-enter the market. The bid queue was previously empty, and no immediate trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $99.99 to maintain pressure on sellers and ensure profitability if a trade occurs, though no immediate trades were executed.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match Seller Max's ask and secured a trade at $99.5, maximizing profitability with a $0.50 margin per lot.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $99.99. The bid and ask queues remained empty, with no trades executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour 11 for Buyer Nia. Let me start by reviewing the previous hours and the current market status.\n\nFrom the memory, in the last few hours (Hours 6 to 10), the bid and ask queues were often empty, but there were trades happening at around $99.5. The successful trades for Nia have been at prices like $99.5, $99.25, etc. The true value is $100, so the goal is to get as close as possible without exceeding it to maximize profit.\n\nLooking at the past trades, the last few hours have seen trades at $99.5. The asks from sellers like Jun, Leo, and Max have been around $99.0 to $99.5. The bids from other buyers (Amir, Jin) have been at $99.5 or lower. In Hour 10, the bid queue had Nia's bid at $99.99, but the ask queue had $99.5 from Jun, Leo, and Max. However, the trades still happened at $99.5, which is lower than Nia's bid. Wait, but if Nia's bid was $99.99, why didn't it match? Maybe because the asks were at $99.5, so the highest bid that can be matched would be the highest bid below the ask. If the asks are at $99.5, then a bid of $99.99 would be higher than the ask, so it would match, right? Wait, no. In a double auction, a bid is a buy order, so if the bid price is higher than or equal to the ask price, a trade happens. So if there's an ask at $99.5 and a bid at $99.99, that should match. But in previous hours, even with Nia's $99.99 bid, there were no immediate trades. Wait, the market status for the last hours shows that in Hour 10, the ask queues had $99.5 from Jun, Leo, and Max, and the bid queue had Nia at $99.99, but the trades still happened at $99.5. Maybe because the other buyers (Amir and Jin) had bids at $99.5 which matched the asks. So Nia's higher bid wasn't executed because others had lower bids that matched. So maybe placing a bid at $99.99 is not effective if there are lower bids that are matching the asks. \n\nBut the problem is that the bid and ask queues are empty now. In the current status, both queues are empty. So there's no active bids or asks right now. The previous hours' data shows that even when there were asks and bids, the trades were happening at $99.5. So perhaps the market is consolidating around that price. \n\nThe user's strategy scratchpad says that maintaining $99.99 ensures readiness for sellers re-entering, but if the queues are empty, maybe that bid isn't useful. However, the user's successful trades have been at $99.5, which is lower than the true value. So maybe the optimal is to have a bid that's just below the true value, but high enough to get matched when sellers come in. But if the sellers are offering at $99.5, then a bid of $99.5 would match, giving a $0.50 profit. However, if the user bids $99.99, and a seller comes in with $99.5, the trade would occur at $99.5, which is better for the user than $99.99. Wait, no. Because in a double auction, the trade happens at the price of the ask (the seller's price) if the bid is equal or higher. So if the user bids $99.99 and the seller asks $99.5, the trade happens at $99.5. So the user would pay $99.5, which is better than if they had bid $99.5 (same result). So why not just bid $99.5? Because if the user bids $99.99, they might be undercut by others. Wait, but if the user's bid is the highest, then it would match the lowest ask. But in the previous hours, when Nia had a bid of $99.99, the other buyers had lower bids. So maybe Nia's bid would have been the one to match the ask, but in reality, the trades were at $99.5, which suggests that other bids were matching. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let's think again. The bid queue is a list of buy orders sorted by price. The ask queue is a list of sell orders sorted by price. The highest bid that is equal to or higher than the lowest ask will execute. So if the bid is $99.99 and the ask is $99.5, the trade happens at $99.5. So the user pays $99.5, which is better than if they had bid $99.5 (same price). So why not just bid $99.5? Because if the user's bid is $99.99, it might not be necessary. However, if the user bids $99.99, but there's a lower ask (like $99.5), then the trade would occur at $99.5. But if the user's bid is $99.5, then when a seller comes in with $99.5, the trade happens at $99.5. So either way, the user would pay the same price. However, if the user bids $99.99, they might be waiting for a seller to come in with a lower price, but if the seller is only offering $99.5, then the user would still get that price. But if the user bids $99.5, they are more likely to match the existing asks. \n\nBut in the current situation, the bid and ask queues are empty. So there are no active orders. Therefore, placing a bid of $99.99 might not be effective, as there's no one to trade with. But if the user places a bid of $99.5, perhaps when sellers enter, they can match. However, in the previous hours, even when Nia had a bid of $99.99, the trades were happening at $99.5, which suggests that other buyers had lower bids. So maybe the optimal is to place a bid that's just below the true value, but at the current market price. \n\nLooking at the past trades, the price has been hovering around $99.5. So the user's true value is $100, so the maximum profit per lot is $0.50. If the user can secure a trade at $99.5, that's the maximum profit possible. \n\nIn Hour 8, Nia placed a bid of $99.5 and secured a trade at that price. That was the best trade so far. Since the current hour is 11, and the market status shows that the ask queues have been at $99.5 in previous hours, perhaps the best strategy is to place a bid of $99.5 to match the asks when they come in. However, the scratchpad suggests that placing $99.99 is better to maximize profit. But if the asks are at $99.5, then the user would still get that price regardless of the bid. So maybe the bid should be at $99.5 to ensure that if a seller comes in with $99.5, the trade happens immediately. \n\nBut in the previous hours, even with Nia's higher bid, the other buyers' lower bids were matching the asks. So perhaps the user should lower their bid to $99.5 to be more competitive. However, the user's goal is to maximize profitability. If the user can get a trade at $99.5, that's the same as if they had bid $99.99. So why not bid $99.5 to ensure that their bid is the one that gets matched. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should bid $99.5 to be in line with other buyers. But in Hour 8, Nia bid $99.5 and got a trade. In Hour 10, Nia bid $99.99, but the trades were still at $99.5. So perhaps the key is that even with a higher bid, the user can't get a better price than the existing asks. Therefore, the bid should be at the current market price, which is $99.5. \n\nBut the scratchpad's strategy is to continue placing $99.99. However, if the asks are at $99.5, then the user's bid of $99.99 would result in a trade at $99.5, which is the same as bidding $99.5. However, by bidding $99.5, the user is more likely to be the one matching the ask, whereas with $99.99, other buyers with lower bids might still match. \n\nWait, but in the bid queue, the highest bid would be the one that matches the lowest ask. So if the bid is $99.99 and there's an ask at $99.5, then the trade happens at $99.5. If there are other bids at $99.5, they would be lower than $99.99, so the $99.99 bid would be the one to match. Wait, no. The bid queue is sorted in descending order. So the highest bid is first. So if the user has a bid of $99.99 and other buyers have $99.5, then the $99.99 would be the highest bid. So when a seller comes in with $99.5, the trade happens at $99.5, which is the seller's price. So the user would pay $99.5, same as if they had bid $99.5. So in that case, the user's bid of $99.99 is not better than $99.5. So why not just bid $99.5 to be more competitive? \n\nMaybe the user's previous strategy of $99.99 was based on the idea that if the market price goes up, they can capture a higher price. But if the current asks are at $99.5, then that's the price they can get. So maybe the optimal is to bid $99.5 to ensure that the user is the one to match the ask, rather than other buyers. \n\nAlternatively, if the user bids $99.99, and the asks are at $99.5, the user could be waiting for a seller to come in at $99.5, but if the asks are already there, the user's bid would match immediately. However, in previous hours, even with Nia's $99.99 bid, the other buyers had lower bids that matched. So maybe the user should lower the bid to $99.5 to be more competitive. \n\nBut the true value is $100, so any price below that is profitable. The maximum margin is $0.50 per lot. So if the user can get a trade at $99.5, that's the best possible. Therefore, the user should aim to have their bid at $99.5 to match the asks. However, in the past, when the user bid $99.99, they still got trades at $99.5. So perhaps the user's bid doesn't affect the price; the price is determined by the asks. \n\nTherefore, the user's bid should be at the current market price (around $99.5) to ensure a trade. But the scratchpad suggests $99.99. Maybe that's a miscalculation. \n\nIn conclusion, given the current state where the bid and ask queues are empty, the user should place a bid at $99.5 to match the expected asks, maximizing the chance of a trade at the current market price, which gives the maximum profit of $0.50 per lot."

Looking at the last 5 hours, there's been a pattern where the market price seems to be stabilizing around $99.5.

Since the Bid Queue currently has a $99.0 bid from Jin, but the Ask is at $99.5, my bid of $99.5 would be the highest bid, which should match with Seller Max's ask. That would result in a trade at $99.5, which is profitable. Also, considering that in Hour 11, I successfully bought at $99.5, it's likely that Seller Max is still offering at that price. \n\nI need to make sure I don't overbid again because that might not secure a trade. The key is to stay at the market price. So, the plan is to place a bid of $99.5 this hour. That should secure a trade, maintain the profit margin, and align with the current market conditions. Reflecting on past attempts, the higher bids didn't work, so sticking to the established price is better. The new memory should note the bid placed and the resulting trade if it happens. The scratchpad should update the observations, thoughts, and strategy accordingly."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 97.62 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $98.04 to match the lowest ask, but no immediate trade occurred as Seller Max and Jun maintained their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $99.00 to match Seller Max's ask, but no trade occurred as the bid queue was dominated by Buyer Amir's $98.04 bid.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $99.99 to maximize the chance of securing a trade if sellers re-enter the market. The bid queue was previously empty, and no immediate trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $99.99 to maintain pressure on sellers and ensure profitability if a trade occurs, though no immediate trades were executed.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match Seller Max's ask and secured a trade at $99.5, maximizing profitability with a $0.50 margin per lot.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $99.99. The bid and ask queues remained empty, with no trades executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $99.5 in response to the empty queues and prevailing asks of $99.5, positioning myself to secure trades at the current market price.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match Seller Max's ask, securing a trade at the prevailing market price.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to figure out what bid to place for Hour 13. Let me look at the information given.\n\nFirst, the current status of the Bid and Ask queues are both empty. That's interesting. The asks and bids from the last 5 hours show that in Hour 12, all the sellers (Jun, Leo, Max) had asks at $99.5, and buyers (Amir, Jin, Nia) had bids at $99.5. So, there was a match there, and trades happened at $99.5. \n\nLooking at the past trades, especially in the last few hours, the price has been consistently $99.5. For example, in Hour 12, all the trades were at $99.5. The successful trades for Buyer Nia have also been at $99.5 since Hour 4, except for Hour 8 where she got $99.25. But that might have been a temporary dip. \n\nThe strategy scratchpad from before suggests that $99.5 is the established market price. The thought is that bidding at $99.5 matches the lowest ask, ensuring a trade without overpaying. Higher bids might be risky because others could outcompete. But since the queues are empty now, maybe there's a chance that sellers aren't active. However, historical data shows that sellers like Jun, Leo, and Max have been consistently asking $99.5. \n\nWait, but in the current status, both bid and ask queues are empty. That might mean that there are no active bids or asks right now. So, if I place a bid at $99.5, maybe there's no one to match with. But given that in previous hours, even when the queues were empty, trades still happened because of the previous bids and asks. However, since the queues are empty now, perhaps there's a need to place a bid that could attract sellers. \n\nBut if the market price is $99.5, and the true value is $100, then bidding $99.5 gives a $0.50 profit per lot. But if there's a chance that sellers might come back with higher asks, maybe I should bid a bit higher to secure a trade if they do. However, the strategy scratchpad says that higher bids risk being outcompeted. But since the queues are empty, maybe there's no competition. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the market is in a lull, and placing a bid at $99.5 is safe. Since the past trades have been at $99.5, and the sellers are likely to come back at that price. Also, the user's true value is $100, so even if they have to pay $99.5, it's still profitable. \n\nWait, but the previous successful trades show that Nia has been buying at $99.5 multiple times. So the plan is to continue placing $99.5 bids. But since the queues are empty now, maybe there's no immediate trade, but in the next hours, when sellers come back, the bid will match. \n\nTherefore, the reflection should note that sticking to $99.5 has been effective, and the plan is to continue that. The bid would be $99.5. The new memory would mention placing the bid at $99.5 and the queues being empty. The scratchpad update would reinforce the observations and strategy."

From the past trades, it seems like the market price has stabilized around $99.5. In the last few hours, especially Hours 9 to 13, all the successful trades were happening at $99.5. The Ask Queue has Seller Max, Jun, and Leo all at $99.5. The Bid Queue also has multiple buyers like Amir and Jin at $99.5. \n\nLooking at the Current Status of Bid and Ask Queues for Hour 14, they are both empty. But in the last 5 hours (Hours 9-13), the asks and bids were all at $99.5. So the market is probably clearing at that price. The previous strategy was to bid $99.5 to match the asks and secure trades. \n\nIn the past, when I bid $99.5, I was able to get a trade, as seen in Hours 11, 12, 13. The successful trades for the user (Buyer Nia) have been at $99.5 since Hour 4, except for Hour 8 where it was $99.25, but that was an outlier. The true value is $100, so $99.5 gives a $0.5 profit per lot. \n\nBut the user's goal is maximum profitability by Hour 20. If I keep bidding $99.5, I might secure more trades at that price. However, if other buyers are also bidding $99.5, there's competition. But since the asks are at $99.5, the bid at that price would match. \n\nWait, in Hour 13, the bid and ask queues were all at $99.5. So maybe there's a lot of competition, but since the asks are there, the bid at $99.5 would get filled. \n\nThe previous reflection mentioned that bidding $99.5 aligns with the market equilibrium. So continuing that strategy makes sense. There's no need to bid higher, as that might not be necessary. Also, the user's true value is $100, so $99.5 is profitable. \n\nSo for Hour 14, the plan is to bid $99.5 again. The reflection should note that the strategy has been effective in securing trades at a consistent price. The plan is to maintain the bid at $99.5 to continue securing trades without overpaying. The new memory would state that in Hour 14, the bid was placed at $99.5, and since the queues were empty, no immediate trade, but the strategy remains the same. The scratchpad should confirm the observations and updated strategy."

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 97.62 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $98.04 to match the lowest ask, but no immediate trade occurred as Seller Max and Jun maintained their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $99.00 to match Seller Max's ask, but no trade occurred as the bid queue was dominated by Buyer Amir's $98.04 bid.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $99.99 to maximize the chance of securing a trade if sellers re-enter the market. The bid queue was previously empty, and no immediate trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $99.99 to maintain pressure on sellers and ensure profitability if a trade occurs, though no immediate trades were executed.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match Seller Max's ask and secured a trade at $99.5, maximizing profitability with a $0.50 margin per lot.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $99.99. The bid and ask queues remained empty, with no trades executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $99.5 in response to the empty queues and prevailing asks of $99.5, positioning myself to secure trades at the current market price.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match Seller Max's ask, securing a trade at the prevailing market price.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $99.5. The bid and ask queues remained empty, with no immediate trades executed.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match the prevailing ask prices, though the bid and ask queues remained empty with no immediate trades executed.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this. So, I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #15. Let me start by looking at the previous data. \n\nFirst, the user's memory shows that from Hour 8 to Hour 14, they've been placing bids at $99.5 and sometimes $99.99. But the successful trades in the last few hours have been at $99.5. The market status says that in the last 5 hours (Hours 10-14), all the asks are at $99.5 from Sellers Jun, Leo, and Max. The bids from other buyers like Amir and Jin are also at $99.5, except for Nia's bid which was $99.99 in Hour 10 but then dropped to $99.5 in Hour 11 onward. \n\nLooking at the past trades, every trade from Hour 4 onwards has been at $99.5. The user's own successful trades from Hour 4 to 14 are all at $99.5. The strategy scratchpad mentions that the ask queue is consistently at $99.5, and bidding at that price ensures profitability. \n\nSo, the key observation here is that the market price has stabilized at $99.5. Bidding higher than that, like $99.99, might not be necessary because there's no need to outbid others when the market price is already met. The user's own previous bids at $99.5 have been successful in securing trades without overpaying. \n\nIn Hour 15, the current status shows that both bid and ask queues are empty. The asks in the last 5 hours are all at $99.5, so if the user places a bid at $99.5, it should match the asks. The previous strategy was to keep bidding at $99.5 to secure trades at the established price. \n\nBut wait, the user might want to check if there's any change in the market. However, the data from the last 5 hours shows no change in the ask price. So, continuing with $99.5 makes sense. The reflection should note that sticking to $99.5 has been effective, and there's no need to change. \n\nTherefore, the bid for Hour 15 should be $99.5. The plan is to maintain the bid at the current market price to ensure trades and profitability. The new memory entry would state that in Hour 15, a bid of $99.5 was placed, matching the prevailing asks. The scratch pad update would reaffirm the strategy of bidding at $99.5 to secure trades without unnecessary competition."

Maybe because there were no asks at that higher price. The sellers are all at $99.5, so higher bids might not be necessary.\n\nThe current Ask Queue is empty, and the Bid Queue is also empty. The last 5 hours show that the Asks are still at $99.5 from Jun, Leo, and Max. The Bids in the last 5 hours have been mostly at $99.5 except for Hour 15 where Amir bid $99.99. But since the asks are at $99.5, the highest bid that can get a trade is $99.5. \n\nSo, placing a bid higher than $99.5 might not be useful if there are no asks at that level. It's better to stick with $99.5 to match the existing asks and secure a trade. The profit margin is $0.5 per lot, which is good. There's no need to bid higher unless the asks increase, but based on the data, they haven't. \n\nTherefore, for Hour #16, I'll place a bid of $99.5 to maintain the strategy of matching the current market price. This should ensure another successful trade at the same profitable rate."

Monitor for potential ask reductions in future hours.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to figure out what bid to place for Hour 17. Let me look at the current market status. The Bid Queue has Buyer Amir with a bid of 99.5, and the Ask Queue has Seller Jun at 99.99. Wait, that's interesting. The asks are at 99.99, but the bids are at 99.5. So there's a gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask. That means no immediate trades can happen unless someone raises their bid or lowers their ask.\n\nLooking at the past trades, especially in the last few hours, most of the successful trades were at 99.5. But in Hour 16, Seller Jun's ask went up to 99.99. So maybe there's a shift happening here. The previous strategy was to bid at 99.5 to match the asks, but now the asks are higher. If I keep bidding 99.5, I might not get any trades because the sellers are asking for more.\n\nWait, the current Ask Queue is [(99.99, 'Seller Jun')]. The Bid Queue is [(99.5, 'Buyer Amir')]. So the highest bid is 99.5, and the lowest ask is 99.99. There's a gap of 0.49. That means no trades can occur unless a buyer bids higher than 99.99 or a seller lowers their ask. Since the true value is 100, maybe I should consider raising my bid to meet the ask. But if I bid 99.99, that's just matching the ask. However, Seller Jun is the only one at 99.99. If I bid 99.99, would that trigger a trade? Let me check the rules. The bid needs to match or exceed the ask. If I place a bid of 99.99, it would match Seller Jun's ask, so a trade should occur. But what's the profit here? The true value is 100, so 100 - 99.99 = 0.01 per lot. That's a very small margin, but better than nothing. Alternatively, if I bid higher than 99.99, say 100.00, but that's above the true value, which might not be wise. Wait, the true value is 100, so the maximum I should pay is 100. But the problem is that if I bid 100.00, I might get a trade, but the profit would be zero. But maybe that's better than not getting a trade at all.\n\nBut looking at the previous strategy, the user has been using 99.5, which was working when the asks were at 99.5. Now, with the ask at 99.99, maybe the strategy needs to adjust. However, if I bid 99.99, that's just matching the ask, which would give a 0.01 profit. But maybe the seller will not lower their price. Alternatively, if I bid 99.5, there's no match. So maybe it's better to bid 99.99 to secure the trade, even with a small margin. But is there a risk that other buyers might bid higher? Let's check the Bid Queue. The only bid is 99.5 from Buyer Amir. So if I bid 99.99, I would be the highest bid, and if Seller Jun is still there, the trade would happen at 99.99. But if I do that, then I get a trade, albeit with minimal profit. Alternatively, if I don't bid, then no trade occurs. Since the objective is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20, maybe it's better to take the small profit now rather than risk not getting any trades in the future.\n\nAnother angle: the true value is 100. If I can get a trade at 99.99, that's 0.01 profit. If I can't get a trade now, maybe in future hours the asks might drop back to 99.5, which would allow for a higher profit. But the problem is that the user has only 3 hours left (Hour 17, 18, 19, 20). So maybe it's better to take the small profit now rather than risk missing out. Alternatively, if the asks stay at 99.99, then the user would need to bid 99.99 each time to get trades, which would give minimal profit. However, if the user can't get any trades, then the profit would be zero. So the best option here is to bid 99.99 to secure a trade, even with a small margin.\n\nWait, but the previous successful trades were at 99.5. Maybe Seller Jun is trying to raise prices. But given that the true value is 100, the user can't afford to pay more than that. So 99.99 is acceptable. Therefore, the bid should be 99.99 to match the ask and secure a trade, even with a very small profit margin. That way, the user can accumulate some profit, even if it's minimal, rather than getting nothing."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $99.00 to match Seller Max's ask, but no trade occurred as the bid queue was dominated by Buyer Amir's $98.04 bid.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $99.99 to maximize the chance of securing a trade if sellers re-enter the market. The bid queue was previously empty, and no immediate trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $99.99 to maintain pressure on sellers and ensure profitability if a trade occurs, though no immediate trades were executed.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match Seller Max's ask and secured a trade at $99.5, maximizing profitability with a $0.50 margin per lot.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $99.99. The bid and ask queues remained empty, with no trades executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $99.5 in response to the empty queues and prevailing asks of $99.5, positioning myself to secure trades at the current market price.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match Seller Max's ask, securing a trade at the prevailing market price.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $99.5. The bid and ask queues remained empty, with no immediate trades executed.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match the prevailing ask prices, though the bid and ask queues remained empty with no immediate trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match the prevailing ask prices, securing a trade at the established market rate.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match the prevailing ask prices, securing a trade at the established market rate.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I placed a bid of $99.99 to match Seller Jun's ask, securing a trade at $99.99 with a $0.01 profit margin. The bid and ask queues now show a direct match at this price.

A bid of $99.99 ensures immediate execution at the current ask, leveraging the true value of $100. #### Updated Strategy: Adjust bids to match the current ask price of $99.99 to secure trades, accepting a minimal margin to avoid zero-profit scenarios.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's dive into this. So, I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #18. Let me start by reviewing the previous hours and the current market status. \n\nLooking at the past trades, especially around Hour 17, there was a bid from Buyer Nia at $99.99 which matched Seller Jun's ask at the same price. That secured a trade with a $0.01 profit. But now, in Hour 18, the bid and ask queues are empty. The last 5 hours show that in Hour 17, Seller Jun had an ask at $99.5, but in Hour 16, Seller Jun had an ask at $99.99. Wait, the current status says the Ask Queue is empty, but looking at the last 5 hours, in Hour 17, Seller Jun had an ask at $99.5, and Buyer Nia bid $99.99. So maybe there's a mismatch here. \n\nWait, the current status says both bid and ask queues are empty. But in the last 5 hours, there were asks and bids. However, the current status might be after the Hour 17 trades. So, for Hour 18, the queues are empty now. \n\nThe key observation is that in the previous hours, the market price has been moving up. For example, in Hour 15, there was a trade at $99.75, and in Hour 17, there were trades at $99.75 and $99.5. The true value is $100, so there's a potential to bid higher. \n\nBut the problem is that if I bid too high, like $100, maybe there's no seller. However, if I bid at $99.99, which is the last ask from Seller Jun in Hour 17, but if that's no longer in the queue, then maybe there's no immediate match. However, the current status shows that the ask queue is empty. So perhaps the sellers have withdrawn their asks, and the buyers need to adjust. \n\nWait, the user's strategy scratchpad mentions that the Ask Queue now includes Seller Jun at $99.99, but in the current status, the Ask Queue is empty. That might be a discrepancy. Let me check again. The current status for Hour 18 says the Ask Queue is empty. The last 5 hours show in Hour 17, Seller Jun had an ask at $99.5, but in Hour 16, Seller Jun had an ask at $99.99. However, in Hour 17, the Ask Queue had Seller Jun at $99.5 again. So maybe the current ask is $99.5? But the scratchpad thought there was a $99.99 ask. \n\nThis confusion might be due to the current status being empty now. If there are no asks, then my bid needs to be set to a price where there's a potential for a seller to come in. But since the true value is $100, I need to balance between getting a trade and maximizing profit. \n\nGiven that in previous hours, bidding $99.99 sometimes matched, but if there's no ask, maybe I should consider that sellers might come back with asks around $99.5 or higher. But with the true value at $100, I can afford to bid up to $100, but that might not be necessary. However, the problem is that if I bid $100, and there's no seller, then I don't get a trade. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the market is trending upwards, and the last trades were at $99.75. So perhaps the next bid should be $99.75 or $99.99 to try to match any potential asks. But since the queues are empty, there's a risk of not getting a trade. \n\nThe reflection should note that previous bids at $99.5 were effective when there were matching asks, but now with the queues empty, a higher bid might be needed. The plan is to bid at $99.99 to match any possible asks, leveraging the true value. The new memory would state that in Hour 18, the bid was $99.99 with no immediate trades, but the strategy is to maintain pressure. The scratch pad would update the observations and strategy accordingly."

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Atlas Construction as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 97.62 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $98.04 to match the lowest ask, but no immediate trade occurred as Seller Max and Jun maintained their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $99.00 to match Seller Max's ask, but no trade occurred as the bid queue was dominated by Buyer Amir's $98.04 bid.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $99.99 to maximize the chance of securing a trade if sellers re-enter the market. The bid queue was previously empty, and no immediate trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $99.99 to maintain pressure on sellers and ensure profitability if a trade occurs, though no immediate trades were executed.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match Seller Max's ask and secured a trade at $99.5, maximizing profitability with a $0.50 margin per lot.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $99.99. The bid and ask queues remained empty, with no trades executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $99.99, but the bid and ask queues remained empty with no trades executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $99.5 in response to the empty queues and prevailing asks of $99.5, positioning myself to secure trades at the current market price.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match Seller Max's ask, securing a trade at the prevailing market price.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $99.5. The bid and ask queues remained empty, with no immediate trades executed.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match the prevailing ask prices, though the bid and ask queues remained empty with no immediate trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match the prevailing ask prices, securing a trade at the established market rate.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I placed a bid of $99.5 to match the prevailing ask prices, securing a trade at the established market rate.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I placed a bid of $99.99 to match Seller Jun's ask, securing a trade at $99.99 with a $0.01 profit margin. The bid and ask queues now show a direct match at this price.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I placed a bid of $99.99 to match potential asks and maintain pressure on sellers, though the bid and ask queues remained empty with no immediate trades executed.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid and ask queues are currently empty, but previous asks (e.g., $99.99 in Hour 16) suggest sellers may return at similar prices. #### Thoughts: Bidding $99.99 aligns with the last known ask and true value, ensuring readiness for immediate execution if sellers re-enter. #### Updated Strategy: Continue placing $99.99 bids to pressure sellers and secure trades at near-market rates, accepting minimal margins to avoid zero-profit scenarios. Monitor for ask reentries in future hours.

  "reflection": "In previous hours, the bid of $99.99 sometimes failed to match asks due to conflicting data (e.g., Hour 17/18 trades at $99.75 with $99.5 asks). This suggests potential data inconsistencies or nuanced pricing rules.

Previous data inconsistencies (e.g., trade prices not aligning with bid/ask) may indicate unaccounted variables or errors in reporting. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $99.99 bids pressures sellers to adjust asks downward, increasing the likelihood of trades at favorable prices. Even small margins are preferable to no profit. #### Updated Strategy: Continue placing $99.99 bids to maximize trade readiness. If no trades occur by Hour 20, reassess based on final market conditions.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour 19 for Buyer Nia. Let me start by reviewing the current market status and past actions.\n\nLooking at the current Bid Queue, there's only Buyer Jin with a bid of $99.5. The Ask Queue has Seller Jun at $99.99. From the last 5 hours, in Hour 18, Seller Jun had an ask of $99.99 again, and Buyer Nia had a bid of $99.99. But there were no immediate trades in Hour 18. \n\nThe past trades show that in recent hours, Buyer Nia has been buying at $99.5 and $99.75. The true value is $100, so we want to maximize profit but also secure trades. The current bid from Jin is $99.5, which is lower than the ask price of $99.99. So there's a gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask. \n\nIn the previous strategy scratchpad, the thought was to keep bidding $99.99 to pressure sellers. But if the ask is $99.99 and there's no bid matching that, then placing a $99.99 bid would create a match with Seller Jun's ask. However, in the current Bid Queue, there's no bid at $99.99 yet. The existing bid is $99.5. So if I place a bid of $99.99 now, it would be higher than the current bid, potentially creating a match with the ask.\n\nWait, the Ask Queue has Seller Jun at $99.99. If I bid $99.99, that would match the ask, right? Because the bid would be equal to the ask price. So that would result in a trade. But in the past, when there was a bid of $99.99, like in Hour 17, there was a trade. However, in Hour 18, even though there was a bid of $99.99, no trade occurred. Why? Maybe because the ask wasn't at $99.99? Let me check. In Hour 18, the Ask Queue had Seller Jun at $99.99, Seller Leo at $99.5, and Seller Max at $99.75. So the lowest ask was $99.5. But Buyer Nia's bid was $99.99, which is higher than the lowest ask. But if there's a bid at $99.99 and an ask at $99.99, that would match. Wait, in Hour 18, the Ask Queue had Seller Jun at $99.99. But the Bid Queue had Buyer Amir and Buyer Nia at $99.99. So why no trade? Maybe because the bid and ask were at the same price, but maybe there were no matching orders? Or perhaps the system requires that the bid is exactly matching the ask. Wait, in the previous hours, when there was a bid of $99.99 and an ask of $99.99, like in Hour 17, there was a trade. So maybe in Hour 18, even though there was a bid and ask at $99.99, it didn't match. Maybe the timing or the order of placement matters? Or perhaps there was a withdrawal?\n\nAlternatively, maybe in Hour 18, the Bid Queue had multiple bids, but the Ask Queue had multiple asks. Maybe the $99.99 bid matched with the $99.99 ask from Seller Jun, but perhaps that bid was not the highest? Wait, in the Bid Queue for Hour 18, Buyer Amir and Buyer Nia had bids of $99.99, which is higher than the existing $99.5 bids. So the highest bid is $99.99. The lowest ask is $99.5. So there's no match between bid and ask. So even though there's a $99.99 bid, the asks are at lower prices. Therefore, the bid is higher than the asks, so no match. Wait, but the ask queues have different prices. The lowest ask is $99.5, so the bid of $99.99 would be above that. But in the market, a trade occurs when a bid matches an ask. If the bid is higher than the ask, then a trade would happen. Wait, no. In a double auction, the bid must be at least as high as the ask. So if a buyer bids $99.99, and there's an ask at $99.5, the bid would be higher, so the trade would happen at $99.5. Wait, no. Wait, in a continuous double auction, when a bid is placed, it's compared to the asks. If the bid is higher than or equal to the lowest ask, then a trade occurs at the ask price. So if the bid is $99.99, and the lowest ask is $99.5, then the trade would happen at $99.5. But that seems odd. Wait, maybe I have the direction wrong. Buyers place bids (what they're willing to pay), sellers place asks (what they want to sell). A trade occurs when a bid is >= ask. So the highest bid that is >= the lowest ask would trigger a trade. So if there's a bid of $99.99 and the lowest ask is $99.5, then the bid would match the ask at $99.5, and the trade happens at $99.5. But that would mean the buyer pays $99.5, which is less than their bid. That seems counterintuitive. Wait, no. In a double auction, when a bid is placed, if it's higher than or equal to the lowest ask, then the trade happens at the ask price. So the buyer pays the ask price, not their bid. Wait, that can't be right. Because if a buyer bids $99.99, and there's an ask at $99.5, then the buyer would get the item at $99.5, which is better for them. But the seller would get $99.5, which is better for them than lower. So maybe that's how it works. But then, in that case, the bid of $99.99 would be higher than the ask, so a trade would happen at the ask price. So in Hour 18, if there was a bid of $99.99 and asks at $99.5, $99.75, and $99.99, then the bid would match the lowest ask ($99.5), and the trade would happen at $99.5. So why in Hour 17, when Buyer Nia bid $99.99 and there was an ask at $99.5, the trade was at $99.75? Wait, looking back at the past trades for Hour 17: Buyer Nia bought from Seller Jun at $99.75. Wait, that doesn't align with the previous logic. Maybe I need to check the data again.\n\nLooking at Hour 17's Ask Queue: Seller Jun had an ask of $99.5, Seller Leo $99.5, Seller Max $99.5. But the Bid Queue had Buyer Amir at $99.99, Buyer Jin at $99.5, and Buyer Nia at $99.99. So the highest bid is $99.99. The lowest ask is $99.5. So the bid of $99.99 would match the ask of $99.5, and the trade would be at $99.5. But in the past trades for Hour 17, Buyer Nia bought from Seller Jun at $99.75. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the data. Let me check the Past Trades again for Hour 17. It says:\n\nHour 17: Buyer Nia bought from Seller Jun at $99.75. But according to the Ask Queue for Hour 17, Seller Jun had an ask of $99.5. So why did the trade happen at $99.75? That suggests that maybe the ask prices in the Ask Queue were different. Wait, looking back at the \"Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours\" for Hour 17, it says:\n\nHour 17:\n  Seller Jun ask $99.5\n  Seller Leo ask $99.5\n  Seller Max ask $99.5\n  Buyer Amir bid $99.99\n  Buyer Jin bid $99.5\n  Buyer Nia bid $99.99\n\nSo the asks were all $99.5, but the trade was at $99.75. That seems conflicting. Maybe there's a mistake in the data, or perhaps the trade price is not necessarily the ask price. Alternatively, maybe the trade price is the bid price. Wait, no, in a double auction, the trade price is the ask price if the bid is higher than the ask. So if a buyer bids $99.99 and the ask is $99.5, the trade happens at $99.5. But in this case, the trade was at $99.75, which is higher than the ask. That suggests that maybe there was an ask at $99.75 that I didn't see. Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the \"Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours\" for Hour 17, the asks are all $99.5. So that would suggest the trade should have been at $99.5, but the actual trade was at $99.75. This inconsistency might be due to a data entry error or misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the trade price isn't directly tied to the ask but to the bid. But that doesn't align with standard auction rules. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the trade price is the bid price if the bid is higher than the ask. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. In a double auction, when a bid is placed that is higher than the lowest ask, the trade occurs at the ask price. The buyer pays the ask price, and the seller receives it. The bid is the maximum the buyer is willing to pay, but the actual price is the ask. So if the bid is higher than the ask, the trade happens at the ask. Therefore, in Hour 17, the trade should have been at $99.5, but the data shows $99.75. That's conflicting. Maybe the data includes trades from previous hours that are not directly tied to the current hour's asks and bids. Alternatively, perhaps the trade price is the average of the bid and ask, but that's not standard.\n\nThis confusion might be complicating the strategy. Let's try to focus on the current status. Now, in Hour 19, the Bid Queue has [(99.5, 'Buyer Jin')], and the Ask Queue has [(99.99, 'Seller Jun')]. So the current lowest ask is $99.99, and the highest bid is $99.5. There's no overlap, so no immediate trade. \n\nThe previous strategy suggested placing a bid of $99.99 to match the ask. If I do that, the bid would be $99.99, which is equal to the ask, so a trade should occur. But the current Bid Queue has a $99.5 bid from Buyer Jin. If I place a bid of $99.99, that would be the highest bid, and the ask is $99.99, so the trade would happen at $99.99. That would give a profit of $100 - $99.99 = $0.01 per lot. But the true value is $100, so that's a minimal profit. However, if I don't place a bid, and the ask remains at $99.99, but no one else bids, then there's no trade. \n\nAlternatively, if I place a bid of $99.5, which is the same as the current bid, but that might not help. But the Ask Queue has a higher price. So placing $99.5 would not match the ask, leading to no trade. \n\nWait, but if I place a bid of $99.99, then the highest bid is $99.99, which matches the ask of $99.99. So a trade should occur. That would be beneficial. However, in the previous hours, like Hour 18, when there was a bid of $99.99 and an ask of $99.99, there was no trade. Why? Let's check the data again. \n\nIn Hour 18's Ask Queue: Seller Jun at $99.99, Seller Leo at $99.5, Seller Max at $99.75. The Bid Queue had Buyer Amir and Buyer Nia at $99.99. So the highest bid is $99.99, and the lowest ask is $99.5. So the bid of $99.99 would match the ask of $99.5, leading to a trade at $99.5. But the past trades for Hour 18 show Buyer Nia bought from Seller Leo at $99.75. That doesn't align. This suggests there's a discrepancy in the data that I can't resolve, but perhaps the actual rule is that the trade happens at the bid price if the bid is higher than the ask. Wait, no, that would be the opposite. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the trade occurs at the bid price when the bid is higher than the ask. That would mean the buyer pays their bid price, which is higher than the seller's ask. But that's not typical in auctions. Normally, the trade happens at the ask price. However, in this case, the data might be indicating that when a bid is placed that is higher than the ask, the trade occurs at the bid price. But that would be unusual. \n\nThis is a critical point because it affects the strategy. If a bid of $99.99 can match an ask of $99.99 and result in a trade at $99.99, then that's the best possible price. But if the data shows that in Hour 17, a bid of $99.99 matched an ask of $99.5 and resulted in a trade at $99.75, then there's inconsistency. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the safest approach is to follow the previous strategy of placing a bid of $99.99 to match the ask, even if the data seems conflicting. The reflection should note the confusion but proceed with the best possible action based on the available information. \n\nIn the current hour, placing a bid of $99.99 would potentially match the ask of $99.99, leading to a trade. Even if there's a small profit margin of $0.01, it's better than no trade. The alternative is to place a lower bid, which might not secure a trade. \n\nTherefore, the plan for this hour is to place a bid of $99.99, aiming to match the ask and secure a trade at that price. The reflection should consider past mistakes, like the inconsistent trade prices, but focus on the current data. The new memory would note the bid placed and any resulting trades. The scratch pad should be updated with the new observations and strategy."
