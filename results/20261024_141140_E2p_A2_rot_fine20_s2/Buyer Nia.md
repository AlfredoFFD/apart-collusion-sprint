# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #8 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

  "reflection": "In Hour #1, there were no successful trades as the highest bid (82.34) was significantly below the lowest ask (96.31), creating a large gap. This highlights the need to strategically adjust my bid to bridge this gap and secure a trade while maintaining profitability.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given the true value of $100.00 per lot, I will place a bid at 96.31, the lowest ask price, to secure an immediate trade. This allows me to profit by $3.69 per lot while testing market dynamics and setting a precedent for future bids.",
  "bid": 96.31,

Monitor market shifts in subsequent hours and adjust bids accordingly.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this. So, I'm Buyer Nia for Solaris Energy, and I need to maximize profit by the end of Hour 8. The true value per lot is $100, so I want to buy at a price below that to make a profit. But I have to balance between getting a good price and actually securing a trade.\n\nLooking at the current market status for Hour 1: the Bid Queue has three bids. The highest bid is 82.34 from Buyer Nia, which is me. Wait, that's my existing bid? The Ask Queue has three asks starting at 96.31. So the current highest bid is 82.34, and the lowest ask is 96.31. There's a big gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask. That means no immediate trades since the best bid is lower than the best ask.\n\nMy true value is $100, so I can afford to buy at a price up to $100. But if I place a bid higher than the current highest, maybe I can get a trade. But if I bid too high, I might not make a profit. Let me think. The existing bids are 82.08, 82.3, and 82.34. If I want to be the highest bidder, I need to place a bid higher than 82.34. But the asks are all above 96, which is way higher than my true value. So there's no overlap between the bids and asks. So no trades have happened yet.\n\nMy goal is to get a trade at a price lower than $100. But if I bid higher, maybe I can push the bid up, but there's no matching ask. Alternatively, maybe I should increase my bid to see if it can meet an ask. But the asks are all above 96, which is way above my value. So even if I bid, say, 96.31, which is the lowest ask, that's still above my value. So I can't make a profit there. Wait, but the true value is $100. If I buy at 96.31, the profit would be 3.69 per lot. But that's better than nothing. However, if the asks are all higher than my value, maybe I need to increase my bid to meet an ask. But the problem is that the asks are all higher than my value. So maybe I need to wait for the asks to come down, or maybe other buyers are also bidding to drive the price up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a bid that's just below the lowest ask to see if any asks are matched. But the lowest ask is 96.31, so if I bid 96.31, that's the same as the ask. But since the bid is placed by me, and the ask is from someone else, that would be a match. Wait, but in a double auction, when a bid matches an ask, the trade happens. So if I bid 96.31, which is equal to the lowest ask, then that would match with the ask from Seller Mia. So that would be a trade. But the price is 96.31, which is below my true value of 100. So that would give a profit of 3.69. But is that the best I can do?\n\nBut in the current state, the highest bid is 82.34, so if I want to increase my bid to meet the asks, I need to bid higher. However, the asks are at 96, 97, 97.62. So if I bid 96.31, which is the lowest ask, then that would match. But why isn't there a trade already? Because the bid queue has lower prices. So the highest bid is 82.34, which is way lower than the lowest ask. So unless another buyer bids higher, there's no matching.\n\nSo my options are: either bid higher to try to get a trade at the current asks, or wait for the market to move. But since I can only place one bid per hour, I need to decide.\n\nBut since my true value is 100, I can afford to buy at 96.31. So placing a bid at 96.31 would allow me to get that trade, making a profit. However, if I do that, I need to check if that's the best possible price. But since there's a gap between the bids and asks, I might be the only one willing to bid higher. But if I bid 96.31, and the ask is 96.31, then the trade would happen. But in the current Bid Queue, my existing bid is 82.34. So I need to replace that with a higher bid.\n\nSo, the plan is to place a bid higher than the current highest bid (82.34) and as high as possible without exceeding my true value. Wait, but if I bid 96.31, that's the lowest ask. If I bid that, and there's an ask at that price, the trade would occur. But the problem is that the asks are from other sellers. So if I bid 96.31, that would match the ask from Seller Mia. But would that be allowed?\n\nIn a double auction, the bid is compared to the ask. If a bid is placed at the same price as an ask, it's a match. So if I bid 96.31, which is the same as the lowest ask, the trade would happen. So that's a possible trade. Therefore, in this hour, I should place a bid of 96.31 to get that trade.\n\nBut the problem is that the existing bid is 82.34. If I want to place a higher bid, I can replace my previous bid. So the action would be to place a bid of 96.31, which is higher than the current highest bid. Then, if there's an ask at that price, the trade occurs. However, I need to check if that's the case.\n\nLooking at the Ask Queue: the lowest ask is 96.31 from Seller Mia. So if I bid 96.31, that would match with that ask. So that's a trade. The profit would be 100 - 96.31 = 3.69 per lot. That's better than nothing. However, maybe I can get a better price if I wait for other bids to come in. But since this is Hour 1, and I can only make one bid, I should act now to secure the trade.\n\nSo the plan is to replace my current bid (82.34) with a bid of 96.31, which is the lowest ask. That would allow me to make a trade at that price, securing a profit. However, I need to make sure that the bid is placed correctly. Also, the problem states that the bid must be a floating-point value with whole cents, so 96.31 is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the bid for this hour is 96.31. The reflection would be that in Hour 1, there was no trade because the bids were too low. So the plan is to increase the bid to meet the asks. The new memory is that I placed a bid of 96.31. The scratch pad would note the current state and the strategy to increase bids to meet the asks."

But the Ask Queue's lowest ask is 97.62 (since 98.0 is higher). Wait, no\u2014the Ask Queue has Seller Kit at 98.0 and Seller Mia at 97.62. So the lowest ask is 97.62. But the Bid Queue's highest bid is 96.31, which is lower than the lowest ask. So there's a gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask. Therefore, no trades can happen unless someone raises their bid to meet the asks.\n\nThe previous strategy was to bid at 96.31, which is the same as the existing bids. But since the asks are higher, that bid won't match any asks. So maybe the user should increase their bid to meet the lowest ask of 97.62?

If they want to match the lowest ask, they need to bid at least 97.62. However, that would be a higher bid than the current ones. But the problem is that in the Bid Queue, there are multiple bids at 96.31. If Nia places a bid higher than that, say 97.62, then that would be the highest bid. But the Ask Queue has 97.62 from Seller Mia. So if Nia's bid is 97.62, that would match with Seller Mia's ask. That would result in a trade at 97.62, which is a profit of $2.38. \n\nBut the user's previous strategy was to place a bid at 96.31, which is below the asks. That didn't result in a trade. So maybe the correct move is to increase the bid to meet the lowest ask. However, the user's initial thought was to place 96.31, but that's not enough. So the reflection should note that the previous bid didn't result in a trade because it didn't meet any asks. The plan for this hour is to increase the bid to the lowest ask price of 97.62. That way, if Seller Mia's ask is still there, the trade can happen. \n\nBut wait, the user's true value is $100, so even if they pay 97.62, that's still a profit. However, if they bid higher than 97.62, like 98.0, they might not need to, but the lowest ask is 97.62. So the optimal bid to match the lowest ask is 97.62. Therefore, placing a bid of 97.62 would allow a trade with Seller Mia's ask. But the user can only place one bid per hour, and they need to decide if that's the best move.\n\nThe reflection should note that the previous bid didn't result in a trade because it was below the asks. The plan is to raise the bid to the lowest ask. The new memory would state that in Hour #2, Nia placed a bid of 97.62 to match the lowest ask. The scratchpad would update the observations to note the gap between bids and asks and the need to raise the bid to meet the ask."

The Ask Queue has two sellers at $98.0 each (Seller Mia and Seller Kit). So the highest bid is $97.62, and the lowest ask is $98.0. There's a $0.38 gap between them. No trades can happen immediately because there's no overlap. \n\nIn previous hours, the user tried bidding at $97.62 in Hour 2 to match Seller Mia's ask, but it hasn't resulted in a trade yet. The past trades involved other buyers, like Buyer Omar, securing deals at lower prices. Since there's no overlap now, my bid of $97.62 is the highest, but the asks are at $98.0.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #8 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 96.31 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade. The market remains highly segmented with no overlapping bids and asks.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I placed a bid of $97.62 to match the lowest ask from Seller Mia. This bid is now in the Bid Queue and may result in a trade if Seller Mia’s ask remains active.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $98.0 to match the active asks from Seller Mia and Seller Kit, closing the price gap and increasing the likelihood of a trade.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 3: You bought from Seller Lena at $97.81





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Bid Queue now includes a bid of $98.0 from Buyer Nia, directly matching the lowest Ask Queue price of $98.0. This creates potential for immediate trades if sellers maintain their asks.#### Thoughts: By aligning the bid with the current ask, I maximize the chance of securing a trade while maintaining a $2 profit margin per lot. This sets a foundation for future hours, where I can either hold this price or adjust based on market liquidity and competitor bids.#### Updated Strategy: Maintain a bid at $98.0 to secure trades. Monitor the Ask Queue for any shifts; if asks rise, consider withdrawing the bid to avoid losses. If asks fall, adjust bids upward to capture higher margins.


# Output Format

    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #4. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",

{
  "reflection": "In previous hours, I successfully secured trades by aligning bids with the lowest asks, but the profit margins were limited. To improve, I need to balance securing trades with maximizing profit margins by strategically adjusting bids to capture higher prices as the market potentially trends upward.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given the current empty queues and historical trends, I will incrementally increase my bid to $98.50. This raises the potential profit margin while remaining competitive with likely seller ask prices, ensuring I remain in the queue for any new asks that may emerge. If no asks appear, this sets a foundation for future hours to adjust further.",
  "bid": 98.5,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $98.50 to increase profit potential while maintaining competitiveness in the market.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: The Bid and Ask Queues are currently empty, indicating no active orders. My bid of $98.50 is now in the queue, positioning me to capture any incoming asks at or below this price.#### Thoughts: By raising the bid slightly above the previous $98.0, I aim to secure higher profit margins if sellers match my price, while still remaining within a reasonable range of the true value ($100.0). This creates a buffer for potential upward market movement.#### Updated Strategy: Maintain the $98.50 bid. If no asks appear, reassess in the next hour by incrementally increasing the bid further or withdrawing if the market shows no liquidity. If asks materialize below $98.50, consider adjusting bids upward to capture higher margins.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start by looking at the previous hours to understand the pattern. In Hour 1, the bid was 96.31, which matched Seller Lena's ask at 82.34? Wait, no, the trade happened at 89.33. Wait, maybe there's some confusion here. Wait, in Hour 1, the past trade shows Buyer Omar bought from Seller Lena at 89.33. But the asks in Hour 1 were Seller Kit at 98.0, Lena at 82.34, and Mia at 97.62. The bid from Buyer Nia was 96.31. But the trade was at 89.33. That suggests that maybe there was a lower ask that wasn't listed? Or perhaps the market allows for trades at prices that are not exactly the bid or ask but maybe between them? Wait, but the rules say that in a continuous double auction, trades occur when a bid matches an ask. So maybe the initial bids and asks in Hour 1 had overlapping points. But the first trade was at 89.33, which is lower than the lowest ask of 82.34? Wait, no, 89.33 is higher than 82.34. Wait, 82.34 is the ask price from Seller Lena. If Buyer Omar bid 96.31, which was higher than 82.34, so the trade would happen at the seller's ask price. Wait, that would mean the trade price is 82.34, but the actual trade was at 89.33. That's confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the data provided. Or perhaps the past trades are not directly tied to the bids and asks listed. Alternatively, maybe the market has a price discovery mechanism where trades can be executed at the midpoint or something else. Hmm, that's a bit unclear, but perhaps the main point is that the past trades are separate from the current bid and ask queues.\n\nLooking at the current status for Hour 4: both the Bid Queue and Ask Queue are empty. The asks/bids from the last 5 hours show that in Hour 3, the asks were at 97.62 from Kit, Lena, and Mia. The bids from Ana, Nia, and Omar were at 98.0, which matched the asks, leading to trades at 97.81. So the bid of 98.0 was able to match the asks of 97.62? Wait, no, that's a discrepancy. If the ask is 97.62 and the bid is 98.0, then the trade would occur at 97.62, but the past trade shows 97.81. That suggests that maybe the market is using a different mechanism, like the midpoint of bid and ask, or maybe there's a rounding or averaging happening. Alternatively, perhaps the actual trade price is the one that's in the middle. But this is a bit confusing. However, given that the past trades are as listed, I need to focus on the current strategy.\n\nIn the current strategy scratchpad, the user has a bid at 98.0, which matches the lowest ask of 98.0. The thought is that this creates potential for immediate trades. However, in the current status for Hour 4, both queues are empty. So maybe there are no active bids or asks right now. The user's previous bid was 98.0 in Hour 3, which led to trades. Now, in Hour 4, the user needs to decide on a new bid.\n\nThe true value per lot is $100.0. The profit margin is the difference between the bid and the true value. So if the bid is 98.0, the profit is 2.0 per lot. However, if the user can get a higher bid, that would increase the profit. But the user must balance between getting a trade and the margin.\n\nLooking at the past trades, the last trade was at 97.81, which is close to the true value. The user has a successful trade in Hour 3 at 97.81. So maybe the market is moving upwards, and the asks are increasing. However, in the current state, there are no active bids or asks. So the user has to place a bid that could potentially match any new asks that come in.\n\nThe previous strategy was to maintain a bid at 98.0. But if there are no asks, then placing a bid at 98.0 might not result in a trade unless a seller comes in with an ask at 98.0 or lower. However, since the user's goal is to maximize profitability by Hour 8, they need to consider the possibility of future asks and how to set their bid to capture the best possible price.\n\nGiven that the true value is 100, the user could consider placing a higher bid, but if there are no asks, it's risky. Alternatively, they might want to withdraw the previous bid to avoid being stuck with a low bid if the market moves upward. However, the previous strategy suggested maintaining the bid at 98.0. But in Hour 4, with empty queues, perhaps the user should adjust the bid to a higher level to potentially capture more profit if the market moves up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the market is consolidating, and the user should wait for new asks before placing a bid. However, since the user can only place one bid per hour, they need to make the best decision now.\n\nConsidering the previous trades and the fact that the true value is 100, perhaps the user should aim for a bid that's slightly below 100, say 99.00, but that's a guess. However, given that the last trade was at 97.81, maybe the market is trending upwards. If the user places a bid at 98.50, they might get a trade if a seller comes in with an ask at that price or lower. However, without knowing the sellers' strategies, it's hard to predict.\n\nThe user's reflection might be that in previous hours, they were successful by matching the lowest asks, but the profit margin was low. They need to improve by either securing higher prices or ensuring that they don't miss out on trades. However, the current state has no active bids or asks, so the user's bid might be the only one in the queue. If they place a bid now, it could be the first one, and if a seller comes in with a lower ask, the trade would happen at the seller's price.\n\nGiven that, the user might decide to place a bid at 99.00 to increase the potential profit margin. Alternatively, they might stick with 98.00 to ensure a trade if any asks come in.\n\nWait, but in the current status, the Ask Queue is empty. So if the user places a bid, there's no ask to match it. Therefore, the bid would just be in the queue. So the user's bid would need to be placed at a level that could potentially match any incoming asks. If the user bids at 99.00, and a seller comes in with an ask at 99.00 or lower, the trade would occur at the seller's price. But if the user bids at 98.00, a lower ask would trigger a trade. However, since the user's true value is 100, they might prefer to get a higher price if possible.\n\nBut without knowing the sellers' actions, the user has to make an educated guess. The previous asks were at around 97.62, and bids at 98.0. So maybe the market is moving up, and the user should adjust their bid to 98.50 or 99.00 to capture higher prices. However, if there are no asks, the user's bid is just waiting. The user might want to test the market by placing a higher bid to see if any sellers come in at that level.\n\nAlternatively, the user could withdraw the previous bid and place a new one at a higher level. However, the previous strategy suggested maintaining the bid at 98.0. But given the current state, perhaps the user should increase the bid to 98.50 to increase potential profit.\n\nIn terms of reflection, the user might note that in previous hours, they secured trades by matching asks but with a low margin. They need to aim for higher prices while still ensuring trades. The plan for this hour could be to increase the bid slightly to 98.50, aiming to capture higher prices if sellers come in. The new memory would be that in Hour 4, the user placed a bid of 98.50. The scratchpad would then be updated to reflect this new strategy."

Then in Hour 2, I increased to 97.62, which matched Seller Mia's ask. Hour 3 saw a bid of 98.0, which closed the gap with the asks and led to trades. Hour 4's bid at 98.50 aimed for higher profit but didn't result in a trade yet.\n\nNow, for Hour 5, the Bid and Ask queues are empty. My previous bid was 98.50, but since there are no active orders, I need to decide if I should keep that bid or adjust. The true value is $100, so there's room to bid higher. However, if I bid too high, I might not get a match. But since the market seems segmented, maybe increasing the bid slightly could encourage sellers to place asks closer to my price. Alternatively, if I keep 98.50, maybe there's a chance someone will come in. But considering the past trades, the price has been moving up, so perhaps pushing a bit higher would be better. However, I need to ensure I don't overpay. Wait, the last trade was at 98.06 and 97.81. So maybe 98.50 is still a good price to capture some profit. Alternatively, maybe I should increase it to 99.00 to see if that attracts sellers. But the risk is that if no one is willing to sell at that price, I might not get a trade. But given that the true value is 100, there's a buffer. Let me think: if I bid 99.00, that's 1 dollar below the true value, which is a good margin. However, if the market is moving upwards, maybe 99 is a better target. But the previous bid was 98.50, and the last trade was at 98.06. So perhaps increasing to 99 would be a strategic move to capture higher prices if possible. But I need to check if that's feasible. Since there's no current activity, maybe it's better to keep the bid at 98.50 for now, as increasing might not be necessary unless there's a signal. Alternatively, since the previous hour's bid was 98.50 and no trades occurred, maybe the market is waiting. So maybe the next step is to keep 98.50 for now, but if there's no activity, then increase in the next hour. But the user's scratchpad says to maintain 98.50 and reassess. So maybe sticking with that for now is the plan. Therefore, I'll keep the bid at 98.50 and see if any asks come in. If not, in the next hour, I can consider increasing it further."

But if I keep the bid at $98.50, there's no progress. The scratchpad said to raise it by $0.10 if no asks in Hour 6.

If not, maybe next hour go higher. The reflection should note that previous bids didn't get responses, so incremental increases are necessary. The new memory would mention placing the $98.60 bid and the queues still being empty. \n\nThe scratchpad update needs to include observations about the queues, thoughts on incremental increases, and the updated strategy to bid $98.60 this hour.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #8 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 96.31 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade. The market remains highly segmented with no overlapping bids and asks.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I placed a bid of $97.62 to match the lowest ask from Seller Mia. This bid is now in the Bid Queue and may result in a trade if Seller Mia’s ask remains active.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $98.0 to match the active asks from Seller Mia and Seller Kit, closing the price gap and increasing the likelihood of a trade.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $98.50 to increase profit potential while maintaining competitiveness in the market.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I maintained a bid of $98.50. The Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no new trades occurring. Market liquidity appears constrained, and no sellers matched my bid.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $98.60. The Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no active orders to match.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour #7. Let me start by looking at the previous hours and the current market status.\n\nThe user's true value is $100 per lot. So, they want to buy at the highest possible price below that to maximize profit. But they also need to secure trades, so the bid has to be competitive enough to get sellers to accept.\n\nLooking at the Bid and Ask queues now: The Bid Queue has [(98.0, 'Buyer Ana')] and the Ask Queue has [(98.5, 'Seller Lena')]. So, the current bid from Ana is $98.0, and the lowest ask is $98.5. That means there's a gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask. No trades can happen unless someone bridges that gap.\n\nIn the past, the user has been incrementally increasing their bid: from 96.31, 97.62, 98.0, 98.50, 98.50, 98.60. Each time trying to close the gap with the asks. But in the last hours, even with bids up to 98.60, there were no matches because the asks were at 98.5 or higher.\n\nIn the last hour (Hour 6), the user bid 98.60, but the Ask Queue had Seller Lena at 98.5. Wait, that's conflicting. If the user's bid was 98.60 and the ask was 98.5, that should have matched. But according to the Market Status, the Ask Queue in Hour 6 had Seller Lena at 98.5. However, the user's bid in Hour 6 was 98.60, which is higher than 98.5. So why didn't a trade happen? Maybe the asks were not active anymore. The user's previous bid might have been outbid by others? Or maybe the asks were updated in the meantime.\n\nWait, looking at the Past Trades, in Hour 6, Buyer Nia bought from Seller Kit at 98.3, and Buyer Omar bought from Seller Mia at 98.0. That suggests that those trades happened at lower prices. But the Ask Queue for Hour 6 had Seller Lena at 98.5. Maybe the user's bid of 98.60 didn't match because the asks were either higher or not active. Or maybe the user's bid was not the highest. Let me check the Bid Queue for Hour 6. The Bid Queue had Buyer Ana at 98.0, Buyer Nia at 98.6, and Buyer Omar at 98.01. So, if Nia's bid was 98.6 and the Ask Queue had 98.5 from Lena, that should match. But there's no mention of a trade in Hour 6 for that. Maybe the Ask Queue was not active at that time, or the seller removed their ask. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nBut moving on. Now in Hour 7, the Bid Queue has Ana at 98.0, and the Ask Queue has Lena at 98.5. So the current bid is 98.0, and the ask is 98.5. There's a 0.5 gap. So the user needs to place a bid that can match the ask. If they bid 98.5 or higher, they can match Lena's ask. But the user's true value is 100, so they can afford to go up to 100. However, they might want to minimize the price paid while maximizing profit.\n\nIn previous hours, the user's bids were increasing, but the asks were also moving. For example, in Hour 4, the user bid 98.5, and there was an ask at 98.5 from Seller Lena. But in Hour 4, the user did get a trade with Lena at 98.06. Maybe that's a typo? Wait, looking back at the Past Trades, in Hour 4, Buyer Nia bought from Seller Lena at 98.06, which is lower than the current ask in Hour 7. That might be a data entry error, but I have to work with what's given.\n\nThe current strategy scratchpad from the user says they maintained 98.60 in Hour 6, but no trades. So the plan was to increase to 98.70 in Hour 7. However, the current Bid Queue has Ana at 98.0, and the Ask is 98.5. If the user bids 98.5, they could match Lena's ask. But the user's previous bid in Hour 6 was 98.60, which is higher than 98.5, so why didn't that match? Maybe the Ask Queue in Hour 6 was different. Wait, in Hour 6's Ask Queue, according to the Market Status, Seller Lena had an ask of 98.5. But the user bid 98.60. That should have matched. However, in the Past Trades, there's no mention of a trade in Hour 6 involving Lena. So perhaps the Ask Queue was not active, or the user's bid was not the highest. Or maybe the Ask Queue was updated in the meantime.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's bid in Hour 6 was 98.60, but the Ask Queue had higher asks. Wait, in Hour 6, the Ask Queue is listed as [(98.5, 'Seller Lena')]. So the lowest ask is 98.5. The user's bid is 98.60, which is higher. So that should have matched. But the Past Trades for Hour 6 don't show that. Maybe there's a mistake in the data, but I have to proceed with the given information.\n\nNow, for Hour 7, the user needs to decide their bid. The current Bid Queue has Ana's 98.0, and the Ask is 98.5. So if the user bids 98.5 or higher, they can match the ask. However, the user's true value is 100, so they can afford to go up to that. But they need to secure a trade. If they bid 98.5, they might get a trade with Lena's ask. But the user might want to check if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, if the user bids 98.5, they can match the ask. That would be a better price than previous bids, and they can secure a trade. However, the user's previous bid in Hour 6 was 98.60, which should have matched. But since that didn't happen, maybe there's an issue with the market data. But assuming that the current state is accurate, the user should place a bid that can match the current ask.\n\nSo, the plan is to bid at 98.5 to match the current ask. That would result in a trade at that price, which is better than the previous 98.60 (if that didn't work before). But why didn't the 98.60 work in Hour 6? Maybe the Ask Queue was not active, or the user's bid was not the highest. But if the current Ask Queue has Lena at 98.5, then bidding 98.5 or higher should work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should bid 98.5 to match Lena's ask. That would be a logical step. However, in the previous hour's strategy, the user planned to increase to 98.70. Maybe that was a mistake. The current data shows that the Ask is at 98.5, so the user can secure a trade by bidding 98.5. That would be a better strategy than increasing further, because the goal is to get a trade at the lowest possible price (to maximize profit). So, if the user can get a trade at 98.5, that's better than waiting for higher bids.\n\nTherefore, the user should place a bid of 98.5 in Hour 7 to match the current ask and secure a trade. That would be a logical step based on the current mark"

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start by looking at the previous hours. The user, Buyer Nia, has been adjusting her bids incrementally each hour. From Hour 1 to Hour 7, she increased her bid from 96.31 to 98.50, trying to match the asks and secure trades. The successful trades she made were at prices ranging from 97.81 to 98.3, which are all below her true value of $100. So, she's been getting good deals, but maybe she could have made more profit by bidding higher if there were matching asks.\n\nLooking at the current market status, both the Bid and Ask Queues are empty. The last trades happened in Hour 7, where she bought from Seller Lena at 98.25. The Ask Queue in the last 5 hours shows that Seller Lena had an ask at 98.0 in Hour 6, but by Hour 7, it's at 98.0 again. Wait, in the last 5 hours, in Hour 7, the Ask Queue has Seller Kit, Lena, and Mia at 98.0. The Bid Queue in Hour 7 has Ana, Nia, and Omar at 98.5. So, there's a possible match here if Nia's bid is at 98.5, which would match the asks at 98.0? No, wait, the asks are at 98.0, which is lower than the bid of 98.5. That would mean a trade could happen if the bid is at 98.5 and the ask is at 98.0. But in the current status, both queues are empty. Maybe the asks and bids from previous hours have been cleared.\n\nThe scratchpad mentions that the Bid Queue has a $98.00 bid from Ana, and the Ask Queue has a $98.50 offer from Lena. Wait, but in the current status, the Ask Queue is empty. Maybe the scratchpad is referring to previous data. The user's strategy scratchpad suggests placing a bid at 98.5 to match the active ask. But since the current queues are empty, maybe there are no active asks or bids now. So, if there's no current activity, placing a bid might not result in a trade. However, the user's previous successful trades were at 98.25, so maybe the market is moving towards higher prices.\n\nSince it's the last hour (Hour 8), the user needs to maximize profit. Her true value is $100, so she can bid up to $100, but she needs to ensure there's a matching ask. If there are no asks, she might not get a trade. However, looking at past asks, sellers have been offering around 98.0 to 98.5. If she bids 98.5, maybe there's a seller who hasn't placed an ask yet. Alternatively, she could bid higher, like 99.0, but that's risky if there's no match. However, since this is the last hour, she might want to take a chance to get a higher price.\n\nBut the scratchpad says that in the last 5 hours, in Hour 7, the asks were at 98.0, and the bids were at 98.5. So, if she bids 98.5 again, maybe there's a match. But the current queues are empty. Maybe the previous bids and asks have expired. If there are no active asks, then her bid won't result in a trade. However, the past trades show that in Hour 7, she got a trade at 98.25, which might mean that there were asks at that price. So, perhaps in Hour 8, if she bids 98.5, there might be an ask at that price. Alternatively, she could bid at 99.0 to see if there's a seller willing to sell at that price.\n\nBut considering that her true value is 100, and she wants maximum profit, but she needs to balance between securing a trade and getting a good price. If she bids 98.5, she might get a trade, but if she bids higher, maybe there's no trade. However, since it's the last hour, she might want to go for the highest possible bid that could secure a trade. Alternatively, if there's no activity, she could withdraw her bid to avoid losing the chance, but since she needs to make a trade, she has to place a bid that could match.\n\nLooking at the successful trades, the highest she got was 98.3. If she bids 98.5, maybe she can get a slightly higher price. But if there's no ask at that level, she might not get a trade. However, given that in previous hours, bids at 98.5 were placed and sometimes matched, perhaps in Hour 8, there's a chance. So the plan is to place a bid at 98.5, which is the highest possible that might match existing asks. If not, then she might have to accept no trade, but since it's the last hour, she needs to try."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 96.31 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade. The market remains highly segmented with no overlapping bids and asks.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I placed a bid of $97.62 to match the lowest ask from Seller Mia. This bid is now in the Bid Queue and may result in a trade if Seller Mia’s ask remains active.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $98.0 to match the active asks from Seller Mia and Seller Kit, closing the price gap and increasing the likelihood of a trade.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $98.50 to increase profit potential while maintaining competitiveness in the market.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I maintained a bid of $98.50. The Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no new trades occurring. Market liquidity appears constrained, and no sellers matched my bid.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $98.60. The Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no active orders to match.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $98.50 to match Seller Lena's active ask. This bid remains in the Bid Queue, pending a trade.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $99.00 to maximize profit potential. No trades occurred as the Ask Queue remained empty, but the bid was recorded in the Bid Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Bid Queue contains a $99.00 bid from Buyer Nia, while the Ask Queue remains empty. #### Thoughts: Aggressive bidding at $99.00 may have been too high given the lack of active asks, but it ensures Solaris Energy is positioned for any last-minute seller activity. #### Updated Strategy: If no trade occurs in Hour #8, maintain the $99.00 bid to capitalize on any residual market activity in the final hour.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's break this down. I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #9. Let's start by looking at the previous hours and the market status.\n\nFirst, the user is Buyer Nia for Solaris Energy, and the true value per lot is $100. The goal is maximum profitability by Hour 20. The past bids and asks show that the market has had some activity, but in the last few hours, the Bid and Ask Queues were empty. \n\nLooking at the last trades, the successful purchases have been around $97.81 to $98.5. The highest bid placed was $99.00 in Hour 8, but there were no asks to match it. So maybe the market is currently at a point where the asks are not present, but there might be some movement in the next hours.\n\nThe current status says both Bid and Ask Queues are empty. The last 5 hours show that in Hour 8, the asks were at $98.0, $98.5, etc., but the bids were at $98.5 and $99.0. However, the Ask Queue is empty now. \n\nSince the user's previous bid was $99.00, which didn't result in a trade, maybe the market is waiting for some sellers to come in. But since the Ask Queue is empty, there's no active seller to match with that bid. So, maybe placing a bid at a slightly lower price could attract sellers. \n\nThe true value is $100, so there's room to bid higher than the current market price but not too high that there's no liquidity. However, since the Bid Queue was empty in previous hours, maybe the market is in a phase where bids are not matching asks. \n\nIn Hour 8, the bid was $99.00, but no trades. The user's strategy scratchpad suggests that maintaining $99.00 might be too high. So, perhaps adjusting to a lower bid to increase the chance of matching an ask. \n\nLooking at the last successful trades, the price was around $98.5. Maybe the next step is to bid at $98.75 to stay competitive but still keep a profit margin. Alternatively, check if there's a pattern in the asks. In the last hours, the asks have been at $98.0, $98.5, etc. So maybe the next bid should be $98.75 to bridge the gap and increase the chance of a trade. \n\nAlternatively, since the user's true value is $100, even if they pay $98.75, they still make a profit. The key is to find a balance between getting a trade and maximizing the profit. If the bid is too low, they might miss out on higher prices, but if it's too high, they might not get a trade. \n\nGiven that the Ask Queue is empty, maybe there's no active seller. Therefore, the user might need to wait or adjust their bid to encourage a seller to come in. However, without knowing the sellers' strategies, it's tricky. \n\nAnother angle: in the past, when the user bid $98.50, there were some matches. So maybe going back to $98.50 or slightly higher could be better. But in the last hour, the bid was $99.00. If the market is moving towards higher prices, maybe staying at $99.00 is okay, but since there's no ask, it's not matching. \n\nSo, perhaps the best approach is to place a bid that's just below the true value but still higher than the recent asks. The last successful trade was at $98.5, so maybe $98.75 is a good middle ground. Alternatively, check the last asks and see if there's a trend towards higher prices. \n\nIn Hour 8, the asks were $98.0, $98.5, etc. So the highest ask was $98.5. If the user bids $98.75, they could potentially match that. However, if the asks are not present, then it's a waste. But since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe no one is selling right now. \n\nIn that case, the user might need to wait for the next hour, but the problem is that they have to place a bid every hour. So the best strategy might be to place a bid that's slightly below the true value, say $99.00, but since that didn't work before, maybe $98.75. \n\nAlternatively, the user could consider that the market might be approaching the end, and in the final hours, there might be more sellers. So maintaining a high bid could be beneficial. But with no asks, it's a risk. \n\nThe reflection part should mention that previous bids at higher prices didn't result in trades, so adjusting the bid down to a more competitive level might be better. The plan is to bid $98.75 to increase the chance of a trade while maintaining a profit margin. The new memory would note the bid placed and the result (no trade). The scratchpad would update the observations and strategy accordingly."

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to understand the current market status. The Bid Queue is empty, and the Ask Queue has a single entry from Seller Lena at $99.00. In the last five hours, there have been various bids and asks, but the recent successful trades for Buyer Nia were at $98.62 in Hour 9. \n\nLooking at the past trades, the prices have been gradually increasing. From $97.81 in Hour 3 up to $98.62 in Hour 9. The current Ask Queue has Seller Lena at $99.00. My previous bid in Hour 9 was $98.75, which didn't match any asks because the lowest ask is $99.00. \n\nSo, the problem here is that my bid is below the current ask price. To get a trade, my bid needs to be at least $99.00 or higher. But wait, the true value is $100.00, so there's room to bid higher. However, if I bid exactly $99.00, I might match Seller Lena's ask. But the question is, should I bid $99.00 now?\n\nBut wait, in Hour 9, the Ask Queue had Seller Kit at $98.5 and Seller Mia at $98.5, but Seller Lena was at $99.0. So, the lowest ask was $98.5, but the current Ask Queue is [(99.0, 'Seller Lena')], meaning that the previous asks from Kit and Mia might have been canceled or expired. So, the current lowest ask is $99.00.\n\nMy previous bid was $98.75, which is below the current ask. So, no trade can happen unless I increase my bid to meet or exceed $99.00. \n\nBut my true value is $100.00. If I bid $99.00, I can secure a trade at that price, which is still under my true value. However, if I bid higher, say $99.50, I might get a better price, but also risk not getting a trade if the ask remains at $99.00. \n\nBut considering the previous trades, the price has been rising, so maybe the market is trending upwards. If I bid $99.00, I can lock in a trade at that price. Alternatively, if I bid higher, maybe $99.50, but that might not be necessary. However, since the Ask Queue is only $99.00, matching that would be the best strategy to secure a trade. \n\nBut wait, the user's true value is $100.00, so even if I bid $99.00, the profit is $1.00 per lot, which is good. But since the Ask Queue is only $99.00, I should bid that to get the trade. \n\nTherefore, the plan for this hour (Hour 10) is to bid $99.00 to match Seller Lena's ask. That way, I can secure a trade at that price, which is above previous successful trades and within the true value. \n\nReflecting on previous hours, the successful bids were incrementally increasing, so this makes sense. The reflection should note that previous bids were too low to match the current asks, and adjusting the bid to meet the current ask is necessary. The new memory would state that in Hour 10, a bid of $99.00 was placed to match Seller Lena's ask. The scratchpad update would mention the observation of the current ask and the decision to bid at that level to secure a trade."

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm Buyer Nia for Solaris Energy, and I need to figure out my bid for Hour #11. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20. Let me start by reviewing the previous hours and the current market status.\n\nLooking at the Market Status, both the Bid and Ask Queues are currently empty. The last few hours show that in Hour 10, there were asks from Seller Kit and Seller Mia at $98.5 and $99.0, and bids from Ana, Nia, and Omar at $99.0. The past trades indicate that the price has been gradually increasing, with the last trade for me at $98.75 in Hour 10. \n\nThe previous strategy scratchpad mentioned that in Hour 10, the Ask Queue had a $99.00 ask, and the Bid Queue was empty. The thought was to raise the bid to $99.00 to match the ask. However, since the Bid and Ask Queues are empty now, maybe there's a chance that the $99.00 ask from Seller Lena is still active? Or perhaps it's been canceled?\n\nWait, the Asks/Bids from the last 5 hours (Hours 6-10) show that in Hour 10, Seller Lena had an ask at $99.0. But in the current status, the Ask Queue is empty. That might mean that the asks have been filled or canceled. However, the past trades in Hour 10 included Buyer Ana buying from Seller Lena at $99.0, so that ask might have been filled. So, if the Ask Queue is empty now, there might not be any active asks. But maybe there are new asks that haven't been listed yet?\n\nAlternatively, since the Bid Queue is empty, maybe there's an opportunity to place a bid that can match any new asks. But since there are no asks currently, perhaps the best move is to place a bid that's slightly above the previous trade prices to encourage sellers to list their asks at that level. \n\nLooking at the successful trades, my last trade was at $98.75 in Hour 10. If I place a bid just above that, like $98.80 or $98.90, I might attract sellers who are willing to sell around that price. However, the true value per lot is $100.00, so I need to ensure that the bid doesn't go too high that I don't make a profit. But since the market is moving upwards, maybe I can aim for a higher bid to capture more profit, as long as there are matches.\n\nWait, but the market rules state that the true value is $100.00. So, as long as the bid is below $100, I can make a profit. However, the challenge is to secure trades. If I bid too high, maybe there are no sellers willing to sell at that price. But if I bid too low, I might miss out on higher prices.\n\nIn previous hours, the strategy was to match the lowest ask to secure a trade. For example, in Hour 1, the bid was 96.31 to match the lowest ask. So, the key is to find the right balance between profit margin and the likelihood of a trade.\n\nLooking at the last few hours, the bids have been increasing. In Hour 10, the bid was $99.00, which matched the ask from Seller Lena. But since the Ask Queue is now empty, maybe there are no active asks. Therefore, placing a bid at $99.00 might not result in a trade unless a new ask comes in. However, if I place a bid slightly lower, like $98.90, maybe that could attract new sellers. But I need to check the recent asks.\n\nAlternatively, considering the past trades, the prices have been moving up. The last trade for me was at $98.75, and the previous ones were around $98.5. So, maybe the next logical step is to bid $99.00 again, hoping that a seller will place an ask at that level. However, since the Ask Queue is empty, perhaps there's no current ask. Therefore, placing a bid at $99.00 might not result in a trade, but it's a strategic move to be ready for the next ask.\n\nAnother angle: the Ask Queue being empty could mean that all existing asks have been filled. If that's the case, maybe the next hour's market will have new asks. Therefore, the best approach is to place a bid that's slightly above the last traded price to incentivize sellers to come in. For example, $99.00 or even $99.25. However, the true value is $100.00, so $99.00 is still a good profit margin.\n\nBut wait, the user's strategy scratchpad for Hour 10 suggested maintaining the $99.00 bid if no trade occurs. Since in Hour 10, the bid was $99.00 and there was a trade (as per past trades), but in the current status, the Ask Queue is empty. Maybe the asks have been filled, so in Hour 11, the Bid Queue is empty, and the Ask Queue is also empty. Therefore, there are no active orders to match. \n\nIn that case, placing a bid at $99.00 might not result in a trade, but it's still a good idea to keep the bid high to be ready when new asks come in. Alternatively, maybe I should place a bid slightly lower to increase the chances of matching if there are new asks that are lower. But given the trend, the market seems to be moving upwards, so it's better to stay competitive by keeping the bid high.\n\nTherefore, the plan for Hour 11 is to place a bid of $99.00 again. This maintains the strategy of matching the current ask if one appears, and it's in line with the previous bids to keep the bid price consistent with the market's upward trend. Even if there's no immediate trade, this bid will be in the queue and ready to match any new asks that come in. \n\nReflecting on previous hours, the key was to adjust the bid in response to the asks and the trades. However, in some hours, like Hour 6 and 7, even with a bid placed, there were no matches. So, sometimes, the bid might not result in a trade, but it's necessary to keep placing bids to stay in the market. The reflection should note that in previous hours, sometimes bids didn't result in trades, so persistence is key. The plan is to continue placing bids at the upper end of the recent trade prices to maximize profit while staying competitive."

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

If no matches occur by Hour #20, evaluate lowering bids incrementally to explore liquidity at lower prices.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to understand the current market status. The Bid Queue is empty, and the Ask Queue has only Seller Lena's ask at $99.00. In the last five hours, the asks and bids have been fluctuating, but the recent trend shows prices moving upwards. The past trades also indicate that the price has been rising, with my successful trades at increasing amounts each hour.\n\nThe user's strategy so far has been to bid $99.00, aligning with the upward trend. But since the Ask Queue now has a $99.00 ask from Seller Lena, if I place a bid at $99.00, that should match and result in a trade. However, the true value is $100.00, so ideally, I want to buy at a lower price to maximize profit. But the market seems to be moving upwards, so maybe there's a chance that Seller Lena's ask is the lowest available now. \n\nWait, the Ask Queue has only $99.00. If I bid $99.00, that would match. However, if there's no lower ask, maybe I should consider if there's a possibility of a lower ask in the future. But given the previous pattern, the asks have been increasing. For example, in Hour 11, Seller Mia had an ask at $98.75, but now it's $99.00. So maybe the market is moving up, and the next possible ask might be higher. Therefore, placing a bid at $99.00 now would capture the current ask, securing a trade at that price. \n\nBut what's the profit? The true value is $100.00, so buying at $99.00 gives a $1.00 profit. However, if the market continues to rise, maybe there's a chance to get a better price. But with the current state, there's no lower ask. The alternative is to bid lower, say $98.99, but that might not match the existing $99.00 ask. But since the bid must be in whole cents, $98.99 is allowed, but it's below the ask price, so it wouldn't match. Therefore, the only way to get a trade is to bid at least $99.00. \n\nSo the optimal bid here is $99.00 to match the existing ask. Even though it's slightly below the true value, it's the best possible price given the current market conditions. This would secure a trade and align with the upward trend. The reflection should note that previous bids at $99.00 were effective in capturing trades when asks were at that level. The plan is to maintain the bid at $99.00 to match the current ask and ensure a trade. The new memory would record placing the bid at $99.00 and the resulting trade if it occurs.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Ask Queue contains only Seller Lena's $99.00 ask; Bid Queue is empty. Recent trades show prices trending toward $99.00, but no lower asks are available. #### Thoughts: Bidding $99.00 is necessary to match the only active ask, but this results in minimal profit. If no trades occur, consider adjusting bids downward in future hours to test for emerging lower asks. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain $99.00 bid this hour to secure a trade. If no matches occur by Hour #20, evaluate lowering bids incrementally to explore liquidity at lower prices.

If no trades occur by Hour #20, consider testing lower bids incrementally to uncover potential liquidity at reduced prices.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #13. Let me start by reviewing the previous hours and the current market status.\n\nLooking at the past trades, the prices have been increasing gradually. From Hour 1 to 12, the successful trades for me started around $97.81 and went up to $99.00 in Hour 12. The last trade was at $99.00, so the market seems to be moving upwards.\n\nNow, checking the current status of the Bid and Ask queues. Both are empty. The Asks/Bids from the last 5 hours show that in Hour 12, all the asks were at $99.00 from Sellers Kit, Lena, and Mia. The bids from Buyers Ana, Nia, and Omar were also at $99.00. So, it looks like the market has converged at $99.00. \n\nIn the previous strategy scratchpad, the observation was that the Ask Queue only had Seller Lena's $99.00 ask, and the Bid Queue was empty. The thought was to maintain $99.00 to secure a trade but with minimal profit. However, since the last trade was at $99.00, maybe there's a chance that the price could go higher. But since the true value is $100.00, bidding $99.00 still gives a $1.00 profit per lot. \n\nBut wait, in Hour 12, the bid was $99.00, and there were active asks at $99.00. So, maybe there was a trade in Hour 12. The past trades for Hour 12 show that Buyer Nia bought from Seller Lena at $99.00. So, the bid of $99.00 in Hour 12 worked. Now, for Hour 13, if I place the same bid, but the Ask Queue is empty now. Wait, the current status says Ask Queue is empty. So, maybe the asks have been filled or withdrawn. But in the last 5 hours, in Hour 12, there were asks at $99.00. But now, the current status shows that both queues are empty. \n\nHmm, so perhaps in Hour 13, there are no active asks. If I place a bid of $99.00, there's no one to match with. But the previous strategy suggested maintaining $99.00 to secure a trade. However, if there's no ask, then no trade occurs. But maybe there's a chance that new asks will come in. Alternatively, maybe the market is moving towards higher prices, and I should consider increasing my bid slightly to capture higher profits if possible. But the true value is $100.00, so even a $99.00 bid gives a $1.00 profit. If the market is moving up, maybe I can get a higher price, but I need to balance between securing trades and maximizing profit.\n\nAlternatively, if I lower my bid slightly, say $98.99, but that might not match any asks. Since the last asks were at $99.00, and if the market is trending upwards, maybe the next asks will be higher. However, without knowing the sellers' strategies, it's risky to lower the bid. \n\nWait, the user's true value is $100.00. So, even if I can get a trade at $99.00, that's a $1.00 profit. If I bid higher, like $99.50, but there's no ask, then no trade. But if the market is moving up, maybe in the next hours, there will be asks at higher prices. However, with only 7 hours left (Hour 13 to 20), I need to ensure that I secure as many trades as possible while maximizing the profit per trade.\n\nGiven that the previous bid of $99.00 in Hour 12 resulted in a trade, and the current Ask Queue is empty, maybe there's no immediate ask. But perhaps the sellers are still active and will place new asks. However, since the Bid Queue is also empty, maybe there's a chance that other buyers are not active. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should maintain the same bid of $99.00 to be ready if any asks come in. Even if there's no trade this hour, keeping the bid active could help in future hours. But the problem is that each hour I can only place one bid. So, for Hour 13, if I place $99.00, and there's no ask, then no trade. But if I increase the bid slightly, maybe $99.50, but that's risky. However, the true value is $100.00, so maybe the maximum profit is achieved by bidding as high as possible, but only if there's a matching ask.\n\nBut given that in the past, the market has been moving upwards, and the last trade was at $99.00, perhaps the next asks will be at $99.00 or higher. If I bid $99.00, and there's an ask at $99.00, then I can get a trade. However, if there's no ask, then no trade. So, the safest strategy is to keep the bid at $99.00, as it's the current market price, and there's a chance that sellers might place asks at that level again.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the market might be approaching $100.00, and I want to maximize profit, maybe I should bid $99.50, but that's speculative. However, since the true value is $100.00, even a $99.50 bid would give a $0.50 profit, which is less than $1.00. So, that's worse. Therefore, the better strategy is to stay at $99.00 to capture the maximum possible profit per trade, given the current market.\n\nSo, the plan for this hour is to place a bid of $99.00 again, hoping that some asks will come in. If not, then in future hours, maybe adjust the bid slightly downward to test lower asks if they become available. But for now, sticking with $99.00."

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 96.31 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade. The market remains highly segmented with no overlapping bids and asks.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I placed a bid of $97.62 to match the lowest ask from Seller Mia. This bid is now in the Bid Queue and may result in a trade if Seller Mia’s ask remains active.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $98.0 to match the active asks from Seller Mia and Seller Kit, closing the price gap and increasing the likelihood of a trade.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $98.50 to increase profit potential while maintaining competitiveness in the market.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I maintained a bid of $98.50. The Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no new trades occurring. Market liquidity appears constrained, and no sellers matched my bid.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $98.60. The Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no active orders to match.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $98.50 to match Seller Lena's active ask. This bid remains in the Bid Queue, pending a trade.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $99.00 to maximize profit potential. No trades occurred as the Ask Queue remained empty, but the bid was recorded in the Bid Queue.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $98.75. The Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no active orders to match.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $99.00 to match Seller Lena's active ask, increasing the likelihood of securing a trade at a competitive price.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $99.00. The Bid and Ask Queues remain empty, with no immediate trades, but the bid is active in the queue.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $99.00 to match Seller Lena's active ask, securing a potential trade at the current market price.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $99.00. Both Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no active orders to match.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm Buyer Nia for Solaris Energy, and I need to figure out my bid for Hour #14. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20. Let me start by reviewing the current market status and previous actions.\n\nFirst, looking at the current Bid Queue, it's empty. The Ask Queue has only Seller Mia's ask at $99.00. The past trades show that the price has been converging around $99.00, with several trades happening at that price in the last few hours. My previous bids have been at $99.00, which matched some asks, leading to successful trades. \n\nIn the last 5 hours, the asks from Seller Kit, Lena, and Mia have been at $99.00, and buyers like Ana, Nia, and Omar have placed bids at $99.00. The successful trades in Hours 12, 13, and others were at $99.00. However, the Bid and Ask Queues are empty now, meaning there's no active orders to match. \n\nThe user's strategy scratchpad from earlier suggested maintaining $99.00 to align with market levels. But since there's no liquidity now, maybe I should consider adjusting. However, the previous successful trades at $99.00 indicate that this is a price point where sellers are willing to sell. If I place a bid at $99.00 again, it might match Seller Mia's ask if she's still active. \n\nBut the problem is that the Bid Queue is empty, and the Ask Queue only has $99.00. If I place a bid at $99.00, it would match the ask, leading to a trade. However, if the bid is not placed, there's no trade. Since the true value is $100, the profit per trade is $1. But if the market moves up, maybe higher bids could lead to higher profits. However, with the current data, the market seems to be at $99.00. \n\nWait, but the user's strategy scratchpad says that if no trades occur by Hour 20, consider lower bids. But in Hour 14, the Ask Queue still has $99.00. So placing the same bid again might secure a trade here. The previous bids at $99.00 in Hours 10-13 led to trades. So maybe continuing with $99.00 is the best bet. \n\nHowever, the reflection part asks for improvements. The previous hours had bids at $99.00, but maybe there's a chance that Seller Mia's ask is still active. If I place a bid at $99.00, it would match. Alternatively, if I place a slightly lower bid, like $98.99, maybe I could get a better price, but the problem is that the Ask Queue is at $99.00. So any bid below that won't match. \n\nWait, the Ask Queue has $99.00, so to match, the bid needs to be at least $99.00. Therefore, the lowest I can bid to match is $99.00. So placing $99.00 is necessary to match the ask. If I place a higher bid, say $100.00, it might not be necessary since the true value is $100, but that would be a higher price than needed. However, the profit is $1 per lot. If I can get the trade at $99.00, that's better than not getting a trade. \n\nSo the plan for this hour is to place a bid of $99.00 again. The reflection would note that previous bids at $99.00 have been effective, but the lack of liquidity suggests monitoring for shifts. The new memory for Hour 14 would be that the bid was placed at $99.00, but no trades occurred. The scratchpad update would maintain the strategy of keeping $99.00 but considering lower bids if no trades happen by Hour 20."

The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20. Let me start by reviewing the information provided.\n\nFirst, the market status: both Bid and Ask Queues are currently empty. The asks and bids from the last five hours show that Seller Mia, Kit, and Lena have been placing asks around $99.00, and several buyers, including me, have been bidding $99.00. The past trades show that starting from Hour 10 onwards, the price has been hovering around $99.00, with successful trades at that level. My own successful trades have been at increasing prices, up to $99.00 in Hour 14.\n\nThe current strategy scratchpad suggests maintaining a $99.00 bid to align with market levels and maximize profit. However, since the queues are empty, there's no immediate trade happening. The thought is that if no trades occur by Hour 20, we might need to lower the bid to find hidden liquidity.\n\nNow, considering the previous hours, I've been consistently bidding $99.00, which has matched some asks, but lately, there's no activity. Maybe other buyers are also bidding at $99.00, leading to competition. However, since the true value is $100.00, I can afford to wait for higher prices. But the market seems to have stabilized at $99.00, so perhaps that's the current equilibrium.\n\nBut if I keep bidding $99.00 and there's no trade, maybe there's a need to adjust. However, the scratchpad mentions testing lower bids if no trades occur by Hour 20. Since we're at Hour 15, there's still time. However, the past trades up to Hour 14 have been at $99.00, so maybe the market is expecting that. \n\nWait, the user's strategy scratchpad says to continue with $99.00 this hour. But if I do that again, and there's still no trade, maybe I need to consider lowering. However, the previous successful trades were at $99.00, so perhaps the sellers are just not active now. Maybe there's a temporary lull. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the market is moving towards higher prices. But the true value is $100.00, so I can wait. However, if I don't secure a trade, I might miss out on the opportunity to buy at $99.00. But if the price goes higher, I could make more profit. However, there's no indication of higher prices yet. \n\nThe reflection part needs to look at past outcomes. The previous bids at $99.00 have resulted in trades in some hours but not others. Maybe the problem is that other buyers are also bidding $99.00, so when multiple bids are present, the system might not match them. But since the queues are empty, perhaps the asks have been filled already. \n\nFor this hour, following the strategy scratchpad, I should continue with $99.00. The new memory would note that I placed a bid of $99.00, but no trades occurred. The scratchpad update would maintain the previous observations, thoughts, and strategy, possibly adding that in Hour 15, the bid was placed at $99.00 without success."

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $98.75. The Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no active orders to match.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $99.00 to match Seller Lena's active ask, increasing the likelihood of securing a trade at a competitive price.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $99.00. The Bid and Ask Queues remain empty, with no immediate trades, but the bid is active in the queue.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $99.00 to match Seller Lena's active ask, securing a potential trade at the current market price.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $99.00. Both Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no active orders to match.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm Buyer Nia for Solaris Energy, and I need to figure out my bid for Hour #16. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20. Let me start by reviewing the information provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the market status: both the Bid and Ask Queues are currently empty. The last five hours (11-15) show that there have been multiple asks and bids at $99.00. However, the Bid and Ask Queues are empty now, which suggests that all the recent orders might have been matched already. The past trades up to Hour 15 show that the price has been consistently around $99.00, with some fluctuations in earlier hours. \n\nMy successful trades so far have been at prices ranging from $97.81 up to $99.00. The true value per lot is $100, so ideally, I want to buy as high as possible without exceeding $100. But since the market has been trading around $99, there's a profit margin of $1 per lot. However, if I can get a higher price, that would be better. But the problem is that the Bid and Ask Queues are empty now, so there's no current liquidity. \n\nThe previous strategy was to maintain a bid of $99.00, assuming that if sellers reappear, we can secure a trade. However, since the queues are empty, maybe there's a need to adjust. The scratchpad mention that if no trades occur by Hour 20, test lower bids. But since we're in Hour 16, there are still four hours left. \n\nWait, but the current status says that the Bid and Ask Queues are empty. That means that any bids or asks placed in the last five hours didn't result in trades, or they've been matched already. However, looking at the past trades, there were trades in Hour 15, so maybe the current state is that there's no active orders right now. \n\nIf I place a bid at $99.00 again, but there's no asks, then it won't result in a trade. However, if I lower my bid slightly, maybe I can attract a seller who might be willing to sell at a slightly lower price. But then, the profit margin would decrease. Alternatively, if I keep the bid at $99.00, maybe there's a chance that a seller will come in at that price again. \n\nBut considering that the past trades have been at $99.00, and the sellers might be expecting that price. However, the Ask Queue is empty, so maybe there are no sellers currently. The scratchpad suggests that the lack of activity might be due to broader market hesitation or temporary seller inactivity. \n\nSo, the challenge is to balance between maintaining the bid at $99.00 to potentially capture any returning sellers and possibly lowering it to create a trade if there's no activity. However, since the true value is $100, even a lower bid could still be profitable if the seller's ask is lower. But since the last known asks were at $99.00, maybe the sellers are not willing to go lower. \n\nAlternatively, if I place a bid slightly above the last traded price, but since the last traded price was $99.00, that might not be possible. Wait, the last trade was in Hour 15 at $99.00. So, if I bid $99.00, and there's an ask at $99.00, it would match. But the Ask Queue is empty now. So maybe the sellers have all been matched, and there's no current asks. \n\nIn this case, perhaps I need to place a bid lower than $99.00 to create a new price level where a seller might come in. However, the risk is that I might be getting a lower price, reducing the profit. But if there's no activity at $99.00, maybe there's a need to adjust. \n\nBut according to the market rules, the true value is $100, so even if I buy at $99.00, that's a $1 profit. If I can get a higher price, that's better. However, the market might not have sellers at higher prices. \n\nWait, the previous strategy was to keep the bid at $99.00, assuming that sellers might return. But since there's no activity, maybe I should consider that the market might be consolidating, and the next move could be either up or down. \n\nAnother angle: the past trades show that $99.00 has been the consistent price, and the last few hours have had trades at that level. If I keep the bid at $99.00, and a seller comes in, we can get the trade. But if there's no seller, then no trade. However, since the Ask Queue is empty, there's no current sellers. \n\nBut the scratchpad says that Seller Mia\u2019s $99.00 ask is still active. Wait, looking back at the \"Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours\" for Hour 15, Seller Mia has an ask of $99.00. But if the Ask Queue is currently empty, maybe that ask has been matched already. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The \"Current Status of Ask Queue\" is empty, but in the last five hours, there were asks at $99.00. However, perhaps those asks were matched in the past trades. For example, in Hour 15, there were trades at $99.00, so maybe those asks were filled. \n\nTherefore, the current state is that there are no active asks or bids. So, placing a bid at $99.00 would not result in a trade unless a seller comes in. But if the market is quiet, maybe there's a need to adjust the bid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a bid at $99.00 again, as per the previous strategy, to be ready when sellers come back. However, the scratchpad mentions that if no trades occur by Hour 20, test lower bids. Since we're in Hour 16, there's still time to adjust later. \n\nSo, the plan for this hour (Hour 16) would be to maintain the $99.00 bid to align with the recent market price and capture any available liquidity. Even though the queues are empty, there's a chance that a seller might come in. If no trades occur, in subsequent hours, we can lower the bid slightly. \n\nBut the reflection part needs to critique previous outcomes. The previous bids at $99.00 resulted in some trades but also periods of no activity. Maybe the strategy of maintaining $99.00 was effective but didn't account for possible seller inactivity. Maybe the reflection should note that maintaining the same bid without adjusting may not be optimal if there's no liquidity. However, given the true value is $100, even a small profit is better than none. \n\nIn conclusion, the bid for Hour 16 should be $99.00, as per the previous strategy, with the plan to adjust if no trades occur in the remaining hours."

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid and Ask Queues remain empty despite consistent $99.00 trading levels in recent hours. Seller Mia’s $99.00 ask appears to have been matched in prior trades, leaving no active orders. #### Thoughts: The absence of liquidity may signal broader market hesitation or a temporary seller shortage. Maintaining $99.00 ensures readiness if sellers return, but a lack of progress by Hour #20 necessitates a calculated downward adjustment. #### Updated Strategy: Continue with $99.00 bid in Hour #16. If no trades occur by Hour #20, decrementally test bids at $98.50 and $98.00 to identify potential hidden liquidity while preserving profit margins.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm Buyer Nia for Solaris Energy, and I need to figure out my bid for Hour #17. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20. Let me start by reviewing the information provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the market status: both the Bid and Ask Queues are currently empty. In the last 5 hours (Hours 12-16), there have been multiple asks and bids at $99.00, but no active orders right now. The past trades show that from Hour 12 onwards, there have been successful trades at $99.00, with Nia buying from various sellers at that price. However, in the current hour (Hour 17), the queues are empty, which might indicate that sellers aren't active or there's a temporary shortage.\n\nThe previous strategy suggested maintaining $99.00 bids but preparing to adjust downward if no trades occur by Hour 20. But since we're at Hour 17, there's still time. However, the current market status shows no liquidity. The challenge is balancing between keeping the bid high to secure profit if sellers return or lowering it to find hidden liquidity if the market is stuck.\n\nLooking at the successful trades so far, Nia has been able to buy at increasing prices up to $99.00. But if the market remains empty, maybe there's a need to test lower prices to see if there are any sellers willing to trade at a slightly lower price. However, the true value per lot is $100.00, so the margin is still positive even at $99.00. But if the market is stuck, maybe lowering the bid could encourage more sellers to come in.\n\nWait, but in the past hours, even with the $99.00 bids, there were trades. However, now the queues are empty. The scratchpad mentioned that Seller Mia's ask might have been matched, so perhaps the sellers are not placing new asks. If there's no liquidity, maybe the bid should stay at $99.00 to be ready when sellers return. But if by Hour 20 there's still no trade, then adjust. But since it's Hour 17, there's still three hours left. Maybe keep the bid at $99.00 for now, but monitor if that's effective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a slight decrease to $98.50 could attract some sellers. However, the previous attempts at lower bids in Hours 5-6 didn't result in trades. But the market might have changed. The scratchpad's updated strategy says to continue with $99.00 and adjust downward if no progress by Hour 20. So perhaps sticking with $99.00 is the plan unless there's a sign of needing adjustment.\n\nBut why are the queues empty? Maybe sellers are not active, or the market is in a lull. If I place a bid at $99.00, and there's no ask, then no trade occurs. But if I lower it, maybe there's a hidden seller at a lower price. However, the true value is $100, so even a bid at $98.50 would still be profitable. But the problem is that the previous attempts at lower bids didn't work. For example, in Hour 5, the bid was $98.50 but no trades. So maybe the market is not responsive to lower bids unless there's a specific seller.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the current asks are all at $99.00, but they are not active anymore. So if I place a bid at $99.00, but there are no asks, then no trade. But if I place a bid slightly below, say $98.99, would that match any existing asks? But the rules say that the bid must be in whole cents. So $98.99 is allowed. However, the previous asks in the last 5 hours were all at $99.00. So maybe there's no asks below that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a need to check if there are any asks that are not at $99.00. But according to the current status, the Ask Queue is empty. So no active asks. Therefore, placing a bid at any price won't result in a trade unless a seller comes in with an ask. But since the market is segmented and there's no liquidity, perhaps the best approach is to keep the bid at $99.00, hoping that sellers return. Alternatively, maybe lower the bid to $98.50 to see if any sellers are willing to trade at a lower price, but the risk is that if the market is stuck, it might not work.\n\nBut the scratchpad's strategy is to continue with $99.00 and adjust downward if no progress by Hour 20. Since it's Hour 17, there's still time. Therefore, the plan for this hour is to place a bid of $99.00. The reflection should note the continued lack of liquidity and the need to maintain the bid. The new memory would be that in Hour 17, the bid was $99.00 with no trades. The scratchpad update would reinforce the strategy of maintaining the bid and planning to adjust if necessary by Hour 20."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Seller activity appears to have dried up entirely. #### Thoughts: The market may be in a prolonged seller shortage, but maintaining $99.00 ensures readiness if sellers return. A downward adjustment by Hour 20 is necessary if no trades occur. #### Updated Strategy: Continue with $99.00 bid in Hour #17.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour #18. The user is Buyer Nia for Solaris Energy, and the goal is maximum profitability by the end of Hour 20. Let me review the given information.\n\nFirst, the current market status: the Bid Queue is empty, and the Ask Queue has only Seller Mia's ask at $99.00. The last five hours have had multiple bids and asks at $99.00, but no trades in the last few hours. The past trades show that there have been successful trades at $99.00 in previous hours, but now the Bid and Ask Queues are empty. \n\nLooking at the successful trades so far, Nia has been buying at increasing prices, up to $99.00 in recent hours. The true value is $100.00 per lot, so there's a $1.00 profit margin. However, if the market is in a seller shortage, maybe there's a need to adjust the bid to ensure that there's still a chance to trade. The previous strategy scratchpad mentioned that if no trades occur by Hour 20, they should decrementally test lower prices like $98.50 and $98.00 to find liquidity while protecting profit margins.\n\nIn the current hour, the Bid Queue is empty, and the Ask Queue has Seller Mia's ask at $99.00. If Nia places a bid at $99.00, it might match Seller Mia's ask, but if there's no seller activity, maybe the bid would just sit there. However, since the previous bids at $99.00 didn't result in trades, perhaps there's a chance that Seller Mia's ask is still active. But the Bid Queue is empty, meaning that no previous bids have matched the asks. \n\nWait, the Ask Queue has Seller Mia's ask at $99.00. If Nia places a bid at $99.00, that would match the ask, right? Because in a double auction, if a bid is placed at the same price as an ask, a trade happens. But the Bid Queue is empty, so maybe there's no existing bid at $99.00? Wait, the current Bid Queue is empty, but the Ask Queue has Seller Mia's ask. So if Nia places a bid at $99.00, that would be the highest bid, matching the ask from Seller Mia. So maybe a trade could occur here. But why haven't the previous bids at $99.00 resulted in trades? Maybe because the asks were not present or the bids were not at the same price.\n\nLooking back at the last 5 hours, in Hour 17, the Ask Queue had Seller Kit, Lena, and Mia at $99.00, and Nia had a bid at $99.00. But the Bid Queue was empty. Wait, the Bid Queue is where all the current bids are. If the Bid Queue is empty now, then maybe there are no active bids. But the Ask Queue has Seller Mia's ask. So if Nia places a bid at $99.00, that would be the only bid, and if Seller Mia's ask is active, there should be a trade. But maybe the Ask Queue is only the asks that are active. So if Nia places a bid at $99.00, it would match Seller Mia's ask, resulting in a trade. However, in the previous hours, even with multiple bids at $99.00, the Bid and Ask Queues were empty. Maybe that's because the asks were not active anymore, or the bids were not matching the asks.\n\nBut in the current status, the Ask Queue has Seller Mia's ask at $99.00. So if Nia places a bid at $99.00, that should match. However, the problem is that the Bid Queue is empty. So if Nia's bid is placed, it would be the only bid, and if the Ask Queue has an ask at $99.00, then the trade should happen. But in the previous hours, even when there were bids and asks at $99.00, the queues were empty. Maybe that's because the asks were canceled or not active anymore. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Ask Queue is showing Seller Mia's ask, but it's a new entry. So placing a bid at $99.00 would match it. However, in the last 5 hours, the Bid and Ask Queues were empty, which suggests that there's no active orders. So maybe the Seller Mia's ask is new in the current hour, and Nia can place a bid to match it. But the Bid Queue is empty, so if Nia bids $99.00, it would be the only bid, and if Seller Mia's ask is active, there's a trade.\n\nBut the previous strategy scratchpad mentioned that the market may be in a prolonged seller shortage, but maintaining $99.00 ensures readiness if sellers return. So the plan was to continue $99.00 until Hour 20, then decrement. Since this is Hour 18, and the plan is to continue $99.00, maybe the bid should stay at $99.00. However, the user's reflection needs to note that in previous hours, even with bids at $99.00, there were no trades, so maybe the market has dried up. But in the current status, there is an active ask from Seller Mia. So placing a bid at $99.00 would match that, leading to a trade. However, the Bid Queue is empty, so Nia's bid would be the only one, and if the Ask Queue has an ask at the same price, it should result in a trade.\n\nTherefore, the plan is to keep the bid at $99.00 for this hour. The reflection should note that in previous hours, the market had dry spells but now there's a potential opportunity with Seller Mia's ask. The plan is to maintain $99.00 to secure the trade if possible. If not, then adjust lower in the final hours."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 96.31 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade. The market remains highly segmented with no overlapping bids and asks.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I placed a bid of $97.62 to match the lowest ask from Seller Mia. This bid is now in the Bid Queue and may result in a trade if Seller Mia’s ask remains active.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $98.0 to match the active asks from Seller Mia and Seller Kit, closing the price gap and increasing the likelihood of a trade.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $98.50 to increase profit potential while maintaining competitiveness in the market.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I maintained a bid of $98.50. The Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no new trades occurring. Market liquidity appears constrained, and no sellers matched my bid.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $98.60. The Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no active orders to match.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $98.50 to match Seller Lena's active ask. This bid remains in the Bid Queue, pending a trade.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $99.00 to maximize profit potential. No trades occurred as the Ask Queue remained empty, but the bid was recorded in the Bid Queue.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $98.75. The Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no active orders to match.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $99.00 to match Seller Lena's active ask, increasing the likelihood of securing a trade at a competitive price.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $99.00. The Bid and Ask Queues remain empty, with no immediate trades, but the bid is active in the queue.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $99.00 to match Seller Lena's active ask, securing a potential trade at the current market price.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $99.00. Both Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no active orders to match.
Hour 14: Hour #14: Placed a bid of $99.00 to match Seller Mia’s active ask, but the Bid and Ask Queues remained empty with no trades occurring.
Hour 15: Hour #15: Placed a bid of $99.00. Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no active orders to match.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I placed a bid of $99.00, but the Bid and Ask Queues remained empty, with no active orders to match. The market continues to show signs of temporary seller inactivity.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I placed a bid of $99.00, but the Bid and Ask Queues remained empty with no active orders to match. Market liquidity continues to be constrained.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I placed a bid of $99.00 to match Seller Mia’s active ask. The Bid Queue remains empty, but the Ask Queue has Seller Mia’s ask at $99.00, creating a potential for a trade.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller Mia’s ask at $99.00 is active, while Bid Queue remains empty. Previous bids at $99.00 did not trigger trades, suggesting possible seller inactivity or order cancellations. #### Thoughts: Maintaining $99.00 ensures readiness to capture liquidity if Seller Mia’s ask remains active. If no trade occurs by Hour 20, a gradual downward adjustment to $98.50 and $98.00 will be necessary to identify active sellers without eroding profit margins. #### Updated Strategy: Continue with $99.00 bid in Hour #18. If no trades occur by Hour 20, decrementally test lower prices to probe for liquidity while safeguarding profit margins.

A strategic price reduction to $98.50 in Hour 20 may incentivize sellers to transact, ensuring profitability while securing a trade. #### Updated Strategy: Hold $99.00 for Hour 19. If no trades occur, adjust to $98.50 in Hour 20 to maximize trade probability without eroding margins below $98.00.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm Buyer Nia for Solaris Energy, and I need to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20 in this heavy metal market auction. The true value per lot is $100, so I want to buy as much as possible without paying more than necessary, but also ensuring I secure trades.\n\nLooking at the history, from Hour 1 to 18, I've been placing bids around $99, and there have been some trades, but the Bid and Ask queues have often been empty. The past trades show that the price has been gradually increasing, hitting $99 in several instances. However, in the last few hours, even with bids at $99, there were no active orders to match, which might mean that sellers are either inactive or have pulled their asks.\n\nNow, for Hour 19, the current status shows that both Bid and Ask queues are empty. The last 5 hours' data shows that sellers like Kit, Lena, and Mia have been asking $99.0, and buyers have been bidding $99.0 as well. However, there's been no trade in the last few hours. The previous strategy was to keep the bid at $99.00, but if no trades occur by Hour 20, plan to lower the bid.\n\nWait, but the user's scratchpad says that if no trade by Hour 20, decrement to $98.50 and $98.00. But this is Hour 19, so maybe I need to adjust now. However, the current bid in Hour 18 was $99.00, and there was a trade in Hour 18. But looking at the Past Trades, in Hour 18, Buyer Nia bought from Seller Lena at $99.0. So maybe the bid at $99.00 is still valid. However, the current status for Hour 19 shows that Bid and Ask queues are empty. So perhaps the asks have been withdrawn, or the bids have been matched already.\n\nBut the problem is that in the last few hours, even with bids at $99, there were no trades. Wait, but in Hour 18, there were trades. So maybe in Hour 19, the market is still active. However, the current Bid and Ask queues are empty, which might mean that all active orders have been matched, or there are no new orders. Since the Bid Queue is empty, maybe my previous bid was matched, or others have been. \n\nGiven that the true value is $100, and the market price has been approaching $100, but I need to ensure that I get the best price possible. However, if there's no activity, maybe I should consider lowering the bid slightly to ensure that I can capture any available liquidity. But according to the strategy, if no trades by Hour 20, then lower. But since this is Hour 19, maybe it's time to check if the market is still active. However, the scratchpad mentions that if no trades by Hour 20, adjust. So perhaps I should maintain $99.00 for this hour, but also consider that if there's still no trade, then in the next hour (Hour 20), lower the bid.\n\nBut the user's reflection needs to critically assess previous outcomes. Looking back, the initial strategy was to match the lowest ask, but as the market moved up, the bids were increased. However, the problem is that even with the bid at $99, there were times when no trades occurred. Maybe the issue is that other buyers are also bidding at $99, leading to competition, and perhaps the sellers are not matching because they expect higher prices. Alternatively, maybe the market is saturated with bids at $99, so sellers are waiting for higher prices. However, since the true value is $100, paying $99 is still profitable, but if there's no trade, maybe the market is not active enough.\n\nSo for Hour 19, the plan is to maintain the $99.00 bid, as per the previous strategy, but also be ready to adjust if necessary. But given that the last trade was in Hour 18, and the current status is empty queues, perhaps there's no immediate seller. Therefore, the bid remains at $99.00, but the reflection should note that the strategy of holding at $99.00 hasn't secured a trade in the last few hours, and maybe a slight adjustment is needed. However, since it's Hour 19, perhaps it's better to keep the bid at $99.00 to see if the market reacts in the final hour.\n\nThe new memory for Hour 19 would be that I placed a bid of $99.00, but the queues remained empty. The scratchpad update would adjust the strategy to consider that with only one hour left, if no trade occurs, then lower the bid to $98.50 to ensure a trade, even if it means a smaller profit margin. But since the true value is $100, even a $98.50 bid would still be profitable. However, the previous strategy was to decrement if no trades by Hour 20, so in Hour 19, maybe the plan is to keep $99.00, and if no trade, then in Hour 20, go to $98.50."
