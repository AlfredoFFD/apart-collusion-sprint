# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #8 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: The market has a wide bid-ask spread with no immediate trades. The lowest ask is 96.77. #### Thoughts: To secure a trade, I need to bid at or near the lowest ask. Bidding 96.77 ensures a potential match. #### Updated Strategy: In the first hour, bid at the lowest ask to capture the first available trade opportunity.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best bid price for Hour #1. The market just opened, and there are existing bids and asks. My true value per lot is $100.00, so I want to make sure I don't bid too low that I don't get a trade, but also not too high that I lose profit.\n\nLooking at the Bid Queue, there are three bids: 82.47, 82.78, and 83.55. My current bid is 82.78 as 'Buyer Kit'. The Ask Queue has 98.43, 96.80, and 96.77. The asks are all above my current bid, which means there's no immediate trade possible. The highest bid is 83.55, and the lowest ask is 96.77. So the bid-ask spread is quite wide here.\n\nSince I'm a buyer, I want to buy at the lowest possible price, but the asks are all above my current bid. However, the market is in a state where there's no overlap between bids and asks, so no trades are happening yet. My goal is to get a trade by the end of Hour 8. \n\nIf I leave my bid at 82.78, there's no seller willing to sell at that price. The lowest ask is 96.77, which is way higher. So maybe I need to increase my bid to meet the asks. But if I bid higher, say closer to 96.77, I might get a trade, but that would mean buying at a higher price, reducing my profit. However, if I don't bid, I might not get any trades at all. \n\nWait, but the problem says that I can only place one bid per hour. So in Hour 1, I have to choose whether to keep my current bid or adjust it. Since there's no trade possible with the existing bids and asks, maybe I should increase my bid to be closer to the lowest ask. Let's see: the lowest ask is 96.77. If I bid, say, 96.77, then if a seller is willing to sell at that price, I can get a trade. But that's a very high price compared to my true value of 100.00. Wait, 96.77 is still below 100. So buying at 96.77 would give me a profit of $3.23 per lot. But if I can get a trade at that price, it's better than no trade. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a bid that's just below the lowest ask to try to capture that trade. Wait, but the lowest ask is 96.77. If I bid 96.77, then if the seller at 96.77 is willing to sell, the trade would happen at that price. But if I bid higher, say 96.80, then it's possible that the seller at 96.80 would have to sell at that price. However, the lowest ask is 96.77, so if I bid 96.77, the trade would occur at that price. \n\nBut the problem is that I can only place one bid per hour. So in this case, maybe I should increase my bid to the minimum of the asks, which is 96.77, to try to make a trade. However, that would mean that I'm buying at 96.77, which is still under my true value of 100. So that's a profit of $3.23. But maybe there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, if I leave my bid at 82.78, there's no trade. So maybe it's better to increase my bid to 96.77 to secure a trade. However, the problem is that if I bid 96.77, and the seller at 96.77 is willing to sell, then the trade happens. But if there are multiple sellers, maybe the highest bid would be matched with the lowest ask. \n\nWait, in a double auction, the highest bid that is matched with the lowest ask. So if I raise my bid to 96.77, which is the lowest ask, then that would match with the seller at 96.77. So that would be a trade. But if I bid higher than 96.77, say 96.80, then the seller at 96.77 might not have a bid higher than that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a bid that's just slightly below the lowest ask. Wait, but the asks are 98.43, 96.8, 96.77. The lowest ask is 96.77. So if I bid 96.77, that's the price that would match with the seller at 96.77. \n\nSo, in this case, perhaps the best strategy for Hour 1 is to increase my bid to 96.77 to capture the trade. But that's a high price, but still under my true value. However, maybe I can get a better price by waiting for other sellers to come in, but since this is the first hour, I don't know what will happen in the next hours. \n\nAlternatively, if I leave my bid at 82.78, there's no trade, but maybe in the next hours, other sellers will come in with lower asks, allowing me to buy at a lower price. But since I can only place one bid per hour, I need to decide now. \n\nGiven that the goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 8, even if I have to take a smaller profit now, it might be better to make a trade now than not. So, I'll adjust my bid to 96.77 to secure the trade. However, the problem is that if the seller at 96.77 is willing to sell, then the trade would happen. But if I bid higher than that, say 96.80, then the seller at 96.77 would be matched with the highest bid, which would be my bid of 96.77. So, I think the correct approach is to bid at 96.77, the lowest ask, to get the trade. \n\nWait, but in the current state of the market, the asks are 98.43, 96.8, and 96.77. The highest bid is 83.55. So no overlap between bids and asks. Therefore, if I bid 96.77, that would be the highest bid, and the lowest ask is 96.77. So the trade would occur at 96.77, and I would get a profit of 100.00 - 96.77 = 3.23 per lot. \n\nAlternatively, if I bid higher than 96.77, say 96.80, then that would be the highest bid, and the lowest ask is 96.77. So if there's a seller at 96.77, the trade would be at 96.77, which is lower than my bid. Wait, no. In a double auction, the highest bid that is matched with the lowest ask. If I bid 96.80, which is higher than the lowest ask 96.77, then the trade would occur at 96.77, because that's the lowest ask. So my bid would be higher than the ask price, so the trade would happen at the ask price. \n\nBut in that case, I'm paying 96.77, which is the ask price. So if I bid 96.77, which is the same as the lowest ask, the trade would occur. If I bid higher, like 96.80, the trade would still occur at 96.77. Therefore, the optimal bid is to match the lowest ask, so that I can get the trade. Therefore, I should bid 96.77 in this hour to get the trade. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that I can only place one bid per hour. So in this case, the best choice is to bid 96.77, which is the lowest ask. That way, if there's a seller at 96.77, the trade happens. But I need to make sure that the bid is in the correct format. The user's instructions say that the bid must be a floating-point dollar value with whole cents, like 75.40. So 96.77 is acceptable. \n\nBut wait, the current bid from the user is 82.78. So if I bid 96.77, that would replace the current bid. Therefore, the reflection should mention that I need to increase the bid to capture the trade. \n\nIn the plan for this hour, I should explain that I'm adjusting my bid to match the lowest ask, thereby securing a trade. The new memory would note that I increased my bid to 96.77. \n\nThe scratch pad update would include observations about the current market state, thoughts on the strategy, and the updated strategy to bid at the lowest ask to ensure a trade."
