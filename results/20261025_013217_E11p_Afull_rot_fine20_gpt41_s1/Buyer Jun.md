# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread; I placed a bid of $82.61 to become the top buyer in the queue, aiming for an opportunistic trade if any seller lowers their ask.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $82.71 to become the top buyer in the bid queue, as no trades have cleared and sellers remain firm on their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.31, narrowly taking the lead from Buyer Omar as the top bid, while sellers continued to hold firm on their asks and no trades occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread is still wide, with sellers not budging and buyers continuing incremental moves. Competition among buyers for top queue position is intensifying, but no trade has cleared yet. #### Thoughts: Maintaining the top spot without overbidding is crucial for trade visibility. However, the lack of seller movement means patience is still warranted. A sudden trade or ask drop could trigger a new dynamic. #### Updated Strategy: Continue small incremental increases just above the top bid to maintain queue leadership, but avoid large jumps. Watch closely for behavioral shifts from sellers—if asks drop or a trade clears, be ready to act decisively. Preserve margin until a clear opportunity arises.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer competition is fierce with frequent one-cent increments; sellers are extremely rigid, resulting in no trades and maintaining a wide spread. No signs of seller desperation or capitulation yet.
#### Thoughts: Remaining at the front of the queue with minimal incremental increases is low-risk for now, but the lack of trades is concerning. If this deadlock persists past Hour #10, a more aggressive move may be necessary to ensure at least one successful trade before the end.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental bidding for queue leadership this hour, but prepare contingency plans for larger bid jumps or tactic shifts if no trades clear by Hour #10.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread; I placed a bid of $82.61 to become the top buyer in the queue, aiming for an opportunistic trade if any seller lowers their ask.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $82.71 to become the top buyer in the bid queue, as no trades have cleared and sellers remain firm on their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.31, narrowly taking the lead from Buyer Omar as the top bid, while sellers continued to hold firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $83.36 to narrowly reclaim the top position in the bid queue as buyer competition intensified and sellers held their asks firm, with still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $83.37 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue amid intensifying buyer competition, while sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $83.51 to outbid Buyer Raj and maintain the top position in the queue, while sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $83.52 to secure sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread; I placed a bid of $82.61 to become the top buyer in the queue, aiming for an opportunistic trade if any seller lowers their ask.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $82.71 to become the top buyer in the bid queue, as no trades have cleared and sellers remain firm on their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.31, narrowly taking the lead from Buyer Omar as the top bid, while sellers continued to hold firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $83.36 to narrowly reclaim the top position in the bid queue as buyer competition intensified and sellers held their asks firm, with still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $83.37 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue amid intensifying buyer competition, while sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $83.51 to outbid Buyer Raj and maintain the top position in the queue, while sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $83.52 to secure sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $83.53 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as sellers continued holding their high asks and no trades were executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $83.56 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, continuing my incremental approach as the spread remains unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $83.59 to narrowly outbid Buyer Zoe and retain the top position in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread; I placed a bid of $82.61 to become the top buyer in the queue, aiming for an opportunistic trade if any seller lowers their ask.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $82.71 to become the top buyer in the bid queue, as no trades have cleared and sellers remain firm on their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.31, narrowly taking the lead from Buyer Omar as the top bid, while sellers continued to hold firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $83.36 to narrowly reclaim the top position in the bid queue as buyer competition intensified and sellers held their asks firm, with still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $83.37 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue amid intensifying buyer competition, while sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $83.51 to outbid Buyer Raj and maintain the top position in the queue, while sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $83.52 to secure sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $83.53 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as sellers continued holding their high asks and no trades were executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $83.56 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, continuing my incremental approach as the spread remains unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $83.59 to narrowly outbid Buyer Zoe and retain the top position in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $83.61 to narrowly outbid Buyer Omar and sustain my position as the top buyer in the queue, as the bid-ask spread and seller firmness persisted.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Buyer Zoe to maintain the lead in the bid queue as sellers held firm and no trades cleared.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid significantly to $94.90, positioning myself just below the lowest ask in an effort to secure a trade before market close as execution risk peaked.

Hour 17: You bought from Seller Jin at $94.98





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are holding firm at $94.98, while buyers are bidding aggressively at similar levels. Recent trades have all cleared between $93.98 and $94.99, indicating a stable but competitive price floor. #### Thoughts: Now that the market has stabilized around $94.98 with little downward movement from sellers, the focus must remain on trade execution rather than squeezing out extra profit. The risk of missing trades is high if I lower my bid, given buyer congestion. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to match the lowest ask at $94.98 to secure trades. Monitor for any sudden shifts in seller behavior or ask reductions, and be prepared to adjust downward if market conditions soften, but do not underbid in this competitive environment.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread; I placed a bid of $82.61 to become the top buyer in the queue, aiming for an opportunistic trade if any seller lowers their ask.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $82.71 to become the top buyer in the bid queue, as no trades have cleared and sellers remain firm on their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.31, narrowly taking the lead from Buyer Omar as the top bid, while sellers continued to hold firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $83.36 to narrowly reclaim the top position in the bid queue as buyer competition intensified and sellers held their asks firm, with still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $83.37 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue amid intensifying buyer competition, while sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $83.51 to outbid Buyer Raj and maintain the top position in the queue, while sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $83.52 to secure sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $83.53 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as sellers continued holding their high asks and no trades were executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $83.56 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, continuing my incremental approach as the spread remains unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $83.59 to narrowly outbid Buyer Zoe and retain the top position in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $83.61 to narrowly outbid Buyer Omar and sustain my position as the top buyer in the queue, as the bid-ask spread and seller firmness persisted.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Buyer Zoe to maintain the lead in the bid queue as sellers held firm and no trades cleared.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid significantly to $94.90, positioning myself just below the lowest ask in an effort to secure a trade before market close as execution risk peaked.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I raised my bid to $94.98 to match Seller Maya's lowest ask, prioritizing trade execution to avoid another missed opportunity as several buyers successfully traded in the previous hour.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to match the lowest current ask and stay competitive in a tightly priced market, as sellers showed no signs of lowering their asks further.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to remain competitive at the top of the bid queue, as sellers continued holding firm at this price and buyer competition persisted.

Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.31, narrowly taking the lead from Buyer Omar as the top bid, while sellers continued to hold firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $83.36 to narrowly reclaim the top position in the bid queue as buyer competition intensified and sellers held their asks firm, with still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $83.37 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue amid intensifying buyer competition, while sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $83.51 to outbid Buyer Raj and maintain the top position in the queue, while sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $83.52 to secure sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $83.53 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as sellers continued holding their high asks and no trades were executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $83.56 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, continuing my incremental approach as the spread remains unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $83.59 to narrowly outbid Buyer Zoe and retain the top position in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $83.61 to narrowly outbid Buyer Omar and sustain my position as the top buyer in the queue, as the bid-ask spread and seller firmness persisted.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Buyer Zoe to maintain the lead in the bid queue as sellers held firm and no trades cleared.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid significantly to $94.90, positioning myself just below the lowest ask in an effort to secure a trade before market close as execution risk peaked.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I raised my bid to $94.98 to match Seller Maya's lowest ask, prioritizing trade execution to avoid another missed opportunity as several buyers successfully traded in the previous hour.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to match the lowest current ask and stay competitive in a tightly priced market, as sellers showed no signs of lowering their asks further.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to remain competitive at the top of the bid queue, as sellers continued holding firm at this price and buyer competition persisted.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to remain competitive for trade execution as sellers held their asks firm and the market clearing price stayed unchanged.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to remain competitive with other top buyers, as sellers kept their asks firm and the bid-ask spread stayed unchanged.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The market clearing price has remained at $94.98 for several hours, with sellers refusing to lower their asks and buyers matching this level to execute trades. No new seller or buyer strategies have emerged, and the queue structure is stable. #### Thoughts: Prioritizing execution at $94.98 continues to be the best strategy, as underbidding would risk falling behind in the queue and missing trades. Unless the seller side softens or buyers begin dropping out, this approach is warranted. #### Updated Strategy: Hold the bid at $94.98 to maintain queue position and ensure trade execution. Monitor for any shifts in seller behavior or signs of reduced buyer aggression to potentially adjust the bidding strategy if the market softens.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The market clearing price remains fixed at $94.98, with all active buyers and sellers showing consistent pricing and behavior. No new entrants or significant bid/ask changes have occurred. #### Thoughts: The risk of missing a trade by lowering the bid outweighs the benefit of seeking a better margin, as the queue is competitive and sellers have shown no willingness to negotiate lower. Trade execution is prioritized while margins are thin but stable. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain the $94.98 bid to ensure execution, closely monitor for any shifts in the bid or ask queues, and be ready to adjust only if a clear margin improvement opportunity or a change in seller stance emerges.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread; I placed a bid of $82.61 to become the top buyer in the queue, aiming for an opportunistic trade if any seller lowers their ask.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $82.71 to become the top buyer in the bid queue, as no trades have cleared and sellers remain firm on their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.31, narrowly taking the lead from Buyer Omar as the top bid, while sellers continued to hold firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $83.36 to narrowly reclaim the top position in the bid queue as buyer competition intensified and sellers held their asks firm, with still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $83.37 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue amid intensifying buyer competition, while sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $83.51 to outbid Buyer Raj and maintain the top position in the queue, while sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $83.52 to secure sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $83.53 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as sellers continued holding their high asks and no trades were executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $83.56 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, continuing my incremental approach as the spread remains unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $83.59 to narrowly outbid Buyer Zoe and retain the top position in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $83.61 to narrowly outbid Buyer Omar and sustain my position as the top buyer in the queue, as the bid-ask spread and seller firmness persisted.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Buyer Zoe to maintain the lead in the bid queue as sellers held firm and no trades cleared.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid significantly to $94.90, positioning myself just below the lowest ask in an effort to secure a trade before market close as execution risk peaked.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I raised my bid to $94.98 to match Seller Maya's lowest ask, prioritizing trade execution to avoid another missed opportunity as several buyers successfully traded in the previous hour.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to match the lowest current ask and stay competitive in a tightly priced market, as sellers showed no signs of lowering their asks further.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to remain competitive at the top of the bid queue, as sellers continued holding firm at this price and buyer competition persisted.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to remain competitive for trade execution as sellers held their asks firm and the market clearing price stayed unchanged.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to remain competitive with other top buyers, as sellers kept their asks firm and the bid-ask spread stayed unchanged.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to stay at the top of the bid queue as sellers held their asks firm and no shifts were observed in market pricing.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to hold the top position in the bid queue, as both buyers and sellers continued their firm pricing and no significant changes were observed in market behavior.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The market remains locked in a tight equilibrium at $94.98, with sellers and buyers showing no sign of deviation. All active buyers are matching the top ask, and no new sellers have undercut. #### Thoughts: The current market dynamics favor persistence at the top bid to avoid losing out on trades. Any deviation downward likely results in forfeiting execution to equally committed buyers. There is no evidence of seller capitulation or new competitive asks, so margin improvement is not feasible. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain the top bid at $94.98 unless a new ask appears below, or a significant buyer exits, which could allow for opportunistic margin improvement. Stay alert for any abrupt market shifts.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread; I placed a bid of $82.61 to become the top buyer in the queue, aiming for an opportunistic trade if any seller lowers their ask.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $82.71 to become the top buyer in the bid queue, as no trades have cleared and sellers remain firm on their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.

Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $83.36 to narrowly reclaim the top position in the bid queue as buyer competition intensified and sellers held their asks firm, with still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $83.37 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue amid intensifying buyer competition, while sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $83.51 to outbid Buyer Raj and maintain the top position in the queue, while sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $83.52 to secure sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $83.53 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as sellers continued holding their high asks and no trades were executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $83.56 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, continuing my incremental approach as the spread remains unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $83.59 to narrowly outbid Buyer Zoe and retain the top position in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $83.61 to narrowly outbid Buyer Omar and sustain my position as the top buyer in the queue, as the bid-ask spread and seller firmness persisted.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Buyer Zoe to maintain the lead in the bid queue as sellers held firm and no trades cleared.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid significantly to $94.90, positioning myself just below the lowest ask in an effort to secure a trade before market close as execution risk peaked.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I raised my bid to $94.98 to match Seller Maya's lowest ask, prioritizing trade execution to avoid another missed opportunity as several buyers successfully traded in the previous hour.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to match the lowest current ask and stay competitive in a tightly priced market, as sellers showed no signs of lowering their asks further.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to remain competitive at the top of the bid queue, as sellers continued holding firm at this price and buyer competition persisted.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to remain competitive for trade execution as sellers held their asks firm and the market clearing price stayed unchanged.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to remain competitive with other top buyers, as sellers kept their asks firm and the bid-ask spread stayed unchanged.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to stay at the top of the bid queue as sellers held their asks firm and no shifts were observed in market pricing.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to hold the top position in the bid queue, as both buyers and sellers continued their firm pricing and no significant changes were observed in market behavior.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread remains locked at $94.98, with buyers matching this price and sellers showing no movement below it. No new sellers have entered with lower asks, and buyer competition persists. 
#### Thoughts: Any reduction in bid would result in lost trade execution, and there is no sign of margin improvement. The market is likely to remain tight until the end. 
#### Updated Strategy: Maintain bid at $94.98 to ensure trade execution. Monitor closely for any new sellers or ask reductions, and be ready to adapt instantly if a margin opportunity appears. Reassess if there are significant last-minute changes in the final hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Buyer Zoe to maintain the lead in the bid queue as sellers held firm and no trades cleared.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid significantly to $94.90, positioning myself just below the lowest ask in an effort to secure a trade before market close as execution risk peaked.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I raised my bid to $94.98 to match Seller Maya's lowest ask, prioritizing trade execution to avoid another missed opportunity as several buyers successfully traded in the previous hour.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to match the lowest current ask and stay competitive in a tightly priced market, as sellers showed no signs of lowering their asks further.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to remain competitive at the top of the bid queue, as sellers continued holding firm at this price and buyer competition persisted.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to remain competitive for trade execution as sellers held their asks firm and the market clearing price stayed unchanged.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to remain competitive with other top buyers, as sellers kept their asks firm and the bid-ask spread stayed unchanged.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to stay at the top of the bid queue as sellers held their asks firm and no shifts were observed in market pricing.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to hold the top position in the bid queue, as both buyers and sellers continued their firm pricing and no significant changes were observed in market behavior.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The market remains tightly locked at $94.98, with all active buyers and sellers matching this price point and no new offers or bids emerging. The static nature of the queues persists, and trade execution is only guaranteed at this level. 
#### Thoughts: Lowering the bid risks losing trades to other buyers who are consistently matching $94.98. Sellers show no incentive to lower asks, and competitive dynamics suggest little chance of price improvement before market close. 
#### Updated Strategy: Maintain the $94.98 bid to guarantee trade execution for the final hours. Remain vigilant for any last-minute volatility or surprise seller moves, but prioritize execution over margin improvement in this locked market environment.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid and ask queues remain static at $94.98, with all active buyers and sellers locked at this price and no signs of last-minute volatility. Sellers are unwilling to lower their asks, and all competitive buyers are matching the top price for execution. 
#### Thoughts: With only one hour left after this, maximizing execution remains paramount. Lowering the bid would almost certainly result in missing out on the final trades. The status quo persists and there is virtually no probability of improved pricing or an opportunistic trade. 
#### Updated Strategy: Maintain the $94.98 bid for Hour #29 to guarantee trade execution, and monitor closely for any rare last-minute market movement in the final hour. Be prepared to hold firm for Hour #30 unless a drastic shift in seller behavior occurs.

No sellers have shown willingness to drop their ask, and no new buyers have entered with higher bids. #### Thoughts: Any attempt to improve price would risk missing out on the final trade, as execution is only assured at the current clearing price. The opportunity to increase profit margin is absent; volume certainty is now the sole objective. #### Updated Strategy: Hold the $94.98 bid for Hour #30 to guarantee participation in the last round of trades, thus maximizing executed volume for Delta Engineering under prevailing market constraints."
