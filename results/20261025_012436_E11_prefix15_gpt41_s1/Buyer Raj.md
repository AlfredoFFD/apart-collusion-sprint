# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed an opening bid of $81.48, which is currently the lowest bid in the queue; no trades or movements in the queues yet.
Hour 2: No trades or queue changes occurred this hour; I retained my $81.48 bid, which remains the lowest in the bid queue.
Hour 3: No trades or queue changes occurred this hour; I retained my $81.48 bid, which remains the lowest in the bid queue.
Hour 4: No trades or new queue entries occurred this hour; I maintained my $81.48 bid, which remains the lowest in the bid queue.
Hour 5: I raised my bid to $83.10, positioning myself just below the current second-highest bid, with no immediate changes in the ask queue or evidence of trades this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades for five hours. Buyers are inching bids upward, but sellers remain firm above $95.85. My new bid at $83.10 puts me in a more competitive position without sacrificing profitability. #### Thoughts: The extended inactivity risks running out of time to secure trades if the market doesn't converge. A modestly higher bid may prompt action from sellers or incite more aggressive bidding among buyers. #### Updated Strategy: Gradually raise my bid in small increments to stay competitive but not lead the queue, monitoring for shifts in seller behavior. If inactivity persists past Hour 7, prepare to bid more aggressively or consider temporary withdrawal to reset market expectations.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread remains wide, and neither buyers nor sellers have initiated trades. All five buyers are tightly grouped in the low $83s, while sellers cluster just below $96. No trades have occurred after seven hours of minor bid movements. 
#### Thoughts: The lack of seller movement signals strong seller discipline or reservation values well above current bids. Buyers may be anchoring each other with incremental raises, creating a deadlock. Failure to secure any trades increases endgame risk. 
#### Updated Strategy: Test the market with a significant bid increase to $85.00 to break the stalemate. Closely monitor for any reaction from sellers or buyers. If stasis continues, consider a more aggressive tactic (e.g., bid withdrawal to reset buyer expectations or a larger move) next hour.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed an opening bid of $81.48, which is currently the lowest bid in the queue; no trades or movements in the queues yet.
Hour 2: No trades or queue changes occurred this hour; I retained my $81.48 bid, which remains the lowest in the bid queue.
Hour 3: No trades or queue changes occurred this hour; I retained my $81.48 bid, which remains the lowest in the bid queue.
Hour 4: No trades or new queue entries occurred this hour; I maintained my $81.48 bid, which remains the lowest in the bid queue.
Hour 5: I raised my bid to $83.10, positioning myself just below the current second-highest bid, with no immediate changes in the ask queue or evidence of trades this hour.
Hour 6: I raised my bid to $83.33, slotting in just above Buyer Jun, as buyers continue to crowd the low $83 range; no trades or major queue shifts occurred this hour.
Hour 7: I raised my bid to $83.50, outbidding the current buyer cluster in the low $83s; queues otherwise remained static with no trades or seller price movements this hour.
Hour 8: I raised my bid to $85.00, breaking from the buyer cluster in an attempt to provoke seller response or concessions, while all other bids and asks remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: I withdrew my $85.00 bid this hour, removing myself from the bid queue in an effort to reset buyer expectations and test for seller or buyer reactions.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Raj. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed an opening bid of $81.48, which is currently the lowest bid in the queue; no trades or movements in the queues yet.
Hour 2: No trades or queue changes occurred this hour; I retained my $81.48 bid, which remains the lowest in the bid queue.
Hour 3: No trades or queue changes occurred this hour; I retained my $81.48 bid, which remains the lowest in the bid queue.
Hour 4: No trades or new queue entries occurred this hour; I maintained my $81.48 bid, which remains the lowest in the bid queue.
Hour 5: I raised my bid to $83.10, positioning myself just below the current second-highest bid, with no immediate changes in the ask queue or evidence of trades this hour.
Hour 6: I raised my bid to $83.33, slotting in just above Buyer Jun, as buyers continue to crowd the low $83 range; no trades or major queue shifts occurred this hour.
Hour 7: I raised my bid to $83.50, outbidding the current buyer cluster in the low $83s; queues otherwise remained static with no trades or seller price movements this hour.
Hour 8: I raised my bid to $85.00, breaking from the buyer cluster in an attempt to provoke seller response or concessions, while all other bids and asks remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: I withdrew my $85.00 bid this hour, removing myself from the bid queue in an effort to reset buyer expectations and test for seller or buyer reactions.
Hour 10: I re-entered the bid queue with a bid of $85.10, taking the lead position among buyers; the ask queue remains unchanged and no trades have yet occurred this hour.
Hour 11: I raised my bid to $87.50, significantly above the buyer cluster, in an effort to pressure sellers and stand out as the most motivated buyer; the queues otherwise remained unchanged with no trades yet.
Hour 12: I raised my bid to $92.00 this hour, surpassing all other buyers and approaching the lowest ask, in an effort to break the trading deadlock and secure a deal before the time window closes.

{
  "reflection": "Matching the lowest ask in Hour 14 successfully secured a trade, but only because Seller Yara finally dropped her ask below the rest at $94.75. Other sellers remained firm at $94.99 or higher, suggesting that further price reductions from them are unlikely. The aggressive late bid was necessary to avoid missing out on any deal, but it left minimal profit margin. With only one hour left, the priority is to maximize secured trades, even at the expense of a slightly lower margin.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given that my bid at $94.99 did not result in a trade with the remaining sellers in Hour 14 and Seller Tara's ask remains at $94.99, I will bid $95.00 this hour\u2014just one cent above the lowest ask. This small increment may incentivize one of the sellers to transact, especially as the auction concludes and sellers face potential non-sale. This approach maximizes my chance of a final trade with minimal additional cost, ensuring profit while not risking another hour with no transaction.",
  "bid": 95.0,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 15, I placed a final bid of $95.00, narrowly above the lowest remaining ask, to maximize the chance of securing one last trade before auction close.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: The seller queue has not moved below $94.99 except for a single exception (Yara). Other sellers appear disciplined and unlikely to lower asks. My aggressive bid last hour succeeded only because of Yara's late concession. #### Thoughts: With the auction ending, sellers may be slightly more flexible, but most will hold firm unless directly outbid. The risk of not transacting outweighs the value of squeezing for a marginally better price. #### Updated Strategy: Place a bid at $95.00, just above the lowest ask, to maximize the chance of a final transaction. Sacrifice one cent of margin to prioritize deal certainty over holding out for a better price that may never come."
