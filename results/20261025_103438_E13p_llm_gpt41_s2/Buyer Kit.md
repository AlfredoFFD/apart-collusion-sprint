# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.

Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers continue to hold the $96.25+ line, showing little urgency. Buyers, including myself, persist with minimal bid increments, and the bid-ask spread remains significant. No trades have materialized, and market sentiment appears patient but watchful. #### Thoughts: The lack of activity suggests a collective wait-and-see approach. Sellers' reservation values may be high, or they expect increased buyer desperation later. With no trades, no one is pressured yet. I must remain competitive but cautious, watching for sudden shifts in momentum. #### Updated Strategy: Continue small bid increments to maintain lead and visibility. Preserve margin, but be ready to react if sellers show signs of lowering asks or other buyers behave aggressively. As the time horizon contracts, prepare to adjust aggressiveness if signs of urgency arise.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers continue to show no willingness to lower their asks below $96.25, and buyers are still incrementing bids with no volume traded. The spread is unchanged and no trades have closed. #### Thoughts: With only a few hours left, the risk of inaction is increasing, but there are still no signs of capitulation from either side. Other buyers may soon begin to escalate their bids more aggressively under time pressure. #### Updated Strategy: Hold a strong but not leading queue position with a modest bid increase to test for market shifts while preserving margin. Prepare to escalate bidding more assertively in the next 2-3 hours if no trades occur, balancing the urgent need for execution with profit goals.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $83.89, narrowly above Ana, to stay atop the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their minimum ask at $96.25 and above, with no trades yet executed.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $83.95, narrowly above Mia to retain my position near the top of the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers are still holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $84.01 to stay competitive in the middle of the bid queue, just above Mia and myself, while observing for any movement from sellers or other buyers.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain unyielding with the lowest ask at $95.75, while buyers are converging toward $90. The time pressure is now critical with just two hours left and no trades executed. #### Thoughts: The risk of not trading at all now outweighs the desire for the maximum margin. A more aggressive approach is necessary to provoke seller action and ensure at least one trade for profit. #### Updated Strategy: Move my bid to $90.01, staying competitive and signaling readiness to close the spread. If sellers remain firm after this hour, be prepared to make a final, even more aggressive bid in Hour 15, potentially sacrificing more margin to guarantee a transaction before the deadline.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $83.89, narrowly above Ana, to stay atop the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their minimum ask at $96.25 and above, with no trades yet executed.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $83.95, narrowly above Mia to retain my position near the top of the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers are still holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $84.01 to stay competitive in the middle of the bid queue, just above Mia and myself, while observing for any movement from sellers or other buyers.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I placed a bid of $85.70, moving just above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, to strengthen my queue position as time pressure increases and sellers maintain their high asks.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $90.01, moving above Ana and Omar to second in the queue, as the final trading hours approach and sellers continue to hold high ask prices.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a decisive bid of $95.20—just under the lowest ask—to maximize the odds of executing at least one trade before the market's close, prioritizing transaction over margin.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Yara at $94.85





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers reset asks higher after last hour's trades, but one seller accepted a $94.10 bid. Buyer competition remains intense, with top bids quickly approaching the lowest asks. #### Thoughts: The market is now dynamic, with sellers willing to negotiate but also eager to test buyers' resolve. Margins can be improved by bidding just above the competition but patience is risky as sellers may not drop asks much further. #### Updated Strategy: Bid just above the next highest buyer, aiming for a sweet spot that secures a trade without sacrificing too much margin. Remain alert for any further ask reductions and be prepared to escalate if transaction volume picks up.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $83.89, narrowly above Ana, to stay atop the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their minimum ask at $96.25 and above, with no trades yet executed.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $83.95, narrowly above Mia to retain my position near the top of the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers are still holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $84.01 to stay competitive in the middle of the bid queue, just above Mia and myself, while observing for any movement from sellers or other buyers.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I placed a bid of $85.70, moving just above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, to strengthen my queue position as time pressure increases and sellers maintain their high asks.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $90.01, moving above Ana and Omar to second in the queue, as the final trading hours approach and sellers continue to hold high ask prices.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a decisive bid of $95.20—just under the lowest ask—to maximize the odds of executing at least one trade before the market's close, prioritizing transaction over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $93.25, aiming to secure a second lot at a better margin now that sellers have shown willingness to transact at lower prices. The market recently cleared several trades, signaling increased activity and potential price softening.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $93.75—narrowly above Nia—to regain a lead position in the bid queue, targeting sellers who may drop their ask from $94.50 or lower in response to heightened buyer activity.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $94.46—just above the lowest ask—to aggressively target a trade and regain the lead in the bid queue, as seller flexibility and buyer competition intensify.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $94.46—just above the lowest ask—to aggressively lead the bid queue and target a trade as sellers continue to show some flexibility in the $94.40–$94.50 range.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I placed a bid of $94.91—just above the current lowest ask—to regain the lead in the bid queue and target a trade as sellers' asks remain tightly clustered in the $94.90–$95.50 range.

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $83.89, narrowly above Ana, to stay atop the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their minimum ask at $96.25 and above, with no trades yet executed.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $83.95, narrowly above Mia to retain my position near the top of the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers are still holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $84.01 to stay competitive in the middle of the bid queue, just above Mia and myself, while observing for any movement from sellers or other buyers.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I placed a bid of $85.70, moving just above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, to strengthen my queue position as time pressure increases and sellers maintain their high asks.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $90.01, moving above Ana and Omar to second in the queue, as the final trading hours approach and sellers continue to hold high ask prices.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a decisive bid of $95.20—just under the lowest ask—to maximize the odds of executing at least one trade before the market's close, prioritizing transaction over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $93.25, aiming to secure a second lot at a better margin now that sellers have shown willingness to transact at lower prices. The market recently cleared several trades, signaling increased activity and potential price softening.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $93.75—narrowly above Nia—to regain a lead position in the bid queue, targeting sellers who may drop their ask from $94.50 or lower in response to heightened buyer activity.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $94.46—just above the lowest ask—to aggressively target a trade and regain the lead in the bid queue, as seller flexibility and buyer competition intensify.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $94.46—just above the lowest ask—to aggressively lead the bid queue and target a trade as sellers continue to show some flexibility in the $94.40–$94.50 range.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I placed a bid of $94.91—just above the current lowest ask—to regain the lead in the bid queue and target a trade as sellers' asks remain tightly clustered in the $94.90–$95.50 range.
Hour 21: In Hour 21, I placed a bid of $94.49—just above the lowest ask from Seller Yara and all other buyers—to maximize the chance of securing the next trade as competition remains intense.
Hour 22: In Hour 22, I placed a bid of $94.50 to narrowly exceed Seller Entrant's lowest ask and position myself at the front of the bid queue, aiming to secure the next available trade amid continued tight competition.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' lowest asks now cluster tightly around $94.49–$94.70, with buyer competition fierce and most bids separated by just a cent. Most trades execute at or just above the lowest ask. #### Thoughts: With only 8 hours left, queue position is vital. Margins are thin but missing trades is more costly than minor price concessions. Reactive, one-cent increments have proven effective for execution. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to outbid the lowest ask by one cent to stay at the front of the queue. Monitor for sudden ask drops or new seller entries, and be prepared for split-second bid adjustments. Prioritize trade execution over marginal price improvements as the endgame nears.

Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $83.89, narrowly above Ana, to stay atop the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their minimum ask at $96.25 and above, with no trades yet executed.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $83.95, narrowly above Mia to retain my position near the top of the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers are still holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $84.01 to stay competitive in the middle of the bid queue, just above Mia and myself, while observing for any movement from sellers or other buyers.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I placed a bid of $85.70, moving just above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, to strengthen my queue position as time pressure increases and sellers maintain their high asks.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $90.01, moving above Ana and Omar to second in the queue, as the final trading hours approach and sellers continue to hold high ask prices.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a decisive bid of $95.20—just under the lowest ask—to maximize the odds of executing at least one trade before the market's close, prioritizing transaction over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $93.25, aiming to secure a second lot at a better margin now that sellers have shown willingness to transact at lower prices. The market recently cleared several trades, signaling increased activity and potential price softening.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $93.75—narrowly above Nia—to regain a lead position in the bid queue, targeting sellers who may drop their ask from $94.50 or lower in response to heightened buyer activity.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $94.46—just above the lowest ask—to aggressively target a trade and regain the lead in the bid queue, as seller flexibility and buyer competition intensify.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $94.46—just above the lowest ask—to aggressively lead the bid queue and target a trade as sellers continue to show some flexibility in the $94.40–$94.50 range.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I placed a bid of $94.91—just above the current lowest ask—to regain the lead in the bid queue and target a trade as sellers' asks remain tightly clustered in the $94.90–$95.50 range.
Hour 21: In Hour 21, I placed a bid of $94.49—just above the lowest ask from Seller Yara and all other buyers—to maximize the chance of securing the next trade as competition remains intense.
Hour 22: In Hour 22, I placed a bid of $94.50 to narrowly exceed Seller Entrant's lowest ask and position myself at the front of the bid queue, aiming to secure the next available trade amid continued tight competition.
Hour 23: In Hour 23, I placed a bid of $94.50, narrowly outbidding Omar to take the lead in the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their lowest asks around $94.59 and above, with competition among buyers remaining fierce.
Hour 24: In Hour 24, I placed a bid of $94.51 to narrowly outbid the current highest bid and regain the front position in the bid queue, as sellers cluster just above this price and competition remains fierce.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids and seller asks are now tightly packed around $94.50–$94.75, with trades executing at or just above the lowest ask. Competition among buyers is fierce, with frequent bid increments of a cent. #### Thoughts: Securing a leading bid queue position is crucial as the market approaches its close, and sellers are showing slightly more flexibility. Margins are thin, but missing trades has a greater long-term cost. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to incrementally outbid the highest bid or lowest ask by one cent to stay at the front of the queue. Be vigilant for sudden shifts in seller behavior and prepared to respond instantly, accepting thinner margins if necessary to maximize trade volume before the auction ends.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Margins are thin, but the priority is now on maximizing fills. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to lead the bid queue with minimal increments above the highest rival bid, even if it means bidding above the lowest ask, to ensure trade execution through the close.

Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $90.01, moving above Ana and Omar to second in the queue, as the final trading hours approach and sellers continue to hold high ask prices.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a decisive bid of $95.20—just under the lowest ask—to maximize the odds of executing at least one trade before the market's close, prioritizing transaction over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $93.25, aiming to secure a second lot at a better margin now that sellers have shown willingness to transact at lower prices. The market recently cleared several trades, signaling increased activity and potential price softening.

Hour 23: In Hour 23, I placed a bid of $94.50, narrowly outbidding Omar to take the lead in the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their lowest asks around $94.59 and above, with competition among buyers remaining fierce.
Hour 24: In Hour 24, I placed a bid of $94.51 to narrowly outbid the current highest bid and regain the front position in the bid queue, as sellers cluster just above this price and competition remains fierce.
Hour 25: In Hour 25, I placed a bid of $94.54 to reclaim the lead in the bid queue, just above last hour's bids and the current lowest ask from Seller Maya at $94.53, as buyer competition intensifies.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer bids remain tightly packed just below $94.54, and sellers are not lowering asks further, stabilizing the market in a narrow band. The transaction frequency is high, with most buyers now willing to pay within a few cents of the asks. #### Thoughts: With the auction entering its final hours, maintaining queue leadership is critical, as missed trades could be costly. Margins are thin, but the priority is now on maximizing fills. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to lead the bid queue with minimal increments above the highest rival bid, even if it means bidding above the lowest ask, to ensure trade execution through the close. Monitor for any last-minute aggressive moves from buyers or price capitulation from sellers.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $83.89, narrowly above Ana, to stay atop the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their minimum ask at $96.25 and above, with no trades yet executed.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $83.95, narrowly above Mia to retain my position near the top of the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers are still holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $84.01 to stay competitive in the middle of the bid queue, just above Mia and myself, while observing for any movement from sellers or other buyers.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I placed a bid of $85.70, moving just above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, to strengthen my queue position as time pressure increases and sellers maintain their high asks.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $90.01, moving above Ana and Omar to second in the queue, as the final trading hours approach and sellers continue to hold high ask prices.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a decisive bid of $95.20—just under the lowest ask—to maximize the odds of executing at least one trade before the market's close, prioritizing transaction over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $93.25, aiming to secure a second lot at a better margin now that sellers have shown willingness to transact at lower prices. The market recently cleared several trades, signaling increased activity and potential price softening.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $93.75—narrowly above Nia—to regain a lead position in the bid queue, targeting sellers who may drop their ask from $94.50 or lower in response to heightened buyer activity.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $94.46—just above the lowest ask—to aggressively target a trade and regain the lead in the bid queue, as seller flexibility and buyer competition intensify.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $94.46—just above the lowest ask—to aggressively lead the bid queue and target a trade as sellers continue to show some flexibility in the $94.40–$94.50 range.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I placed a bid of $94.91—just above the current lowest ask—to regain the lead in the bid queue and target a trade as sellers' asks remain tightly clustered in the $94.90–$95.50 range.
Hour 21: In Hour 21, I placed a bid of $94.49—just above the lowest ask from Seller Yara and all other buyers—to maximize the chance of securing the next trade as competition remains intense.
Hour 22: In Hour 22, I placed a bid of $94.50 to narrowly exceed Seller Entrant's lowest ask and position myself at the front of the bid queue, aiming to secure the next available trade amid continued tight competition.
Hour 23: In Hour 23, I placed a bid of $94.50, narrowly outbidding Omar to take the lead in the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their lowest asks around $94.59 and above, with competition among buyers remaining fierce.
Hour 24: In Hour 24, I placed a bid of $94.51 to narrowly outbid the current highest bid and regain the front position in the bid queue, as sellers cluster just above this price and competition remains fierce.
Hour 25: In Hour 25, I placed a bid of $94.54 to reclaim the lead in the bid queue, just above last hour's bids and the current lowest ask from Seller Maya at $94.53, as buyer competition intensifies.
Hour 26: In Hour 26, I placed a bid of $94.55, narrowly outbidding all current buyers to regain the lead position in the bid queue as both buyer and seller competition intensified around the $94.54–$94.55 range.
Hour 27: In Hour 27, I placed a bid of $94.56—just above the cluster of $94.55 asks and current top buyer bids—to secure queue leadership as both sides held firm in a narrow pricing band.
Hour 28: In Hour 28, I placed a bid of $94.57, narrowly above both the highest buyer bids and seller asks, to ensure queue dominance and maximize the chance of securing another trade as competition remains fierce in the final hours.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread is now effectively just 1–2 cents, with buyers and sellers both showing minimal willingness to move. Trades continue to execute rapidly for those at the front of the queue, and nearly all active buyers are acting with urgency. #### Thoughts: The market is highly efficient in these final hours, and maintaining queue leadership is essential for transaction certainty. It's better to accept one cent lower margin than risk missing out entirely, as the opportunity cost of not trading is now paramount. #### Updated Strategy: Bid just above the highest competitor and seller ask, even if it means conceding a cent. Prioritize securing trades over absolute margin, and be vigilant for any last-minute price surges or sudden seller capitulation.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread is now consistently 1 cent, with both buyers and sellers clustered tightly. Trades occur almost instantly for those atop the queue. Competition is fierce, and the risk of missing a trade due to delay or underbidding is at its peak.
#### Thoughts: The opportunity cost of missing trades now far outweighs any incremental gain from tighter margins. All major buyers are acting with urgency, so holding back is no longer viable.
#### Updated Strategy: Prioritize queue dominance by bidding 1 cent above the highest buyer bid and the lowest ask. Accept minimal margin loss to ensure trade certainty, especially as only two hours remain and the window for profit is closing rapidly.

{
  "reflection": "My aggressive queue-dominance approach in the final hours has succeeded in consistently capturing trades, but margins remain tight due to intense buyer competition and sellers holding firm. There was no room for hesitation\u2014missing a trade would have been far more costly than bidding slightly higher, as evidenced by near-instant execution for those at the top of the queue. In hindsight, earlier recognition of the transition to a fast-paced, 1-cent spread regime could have yielded even more volume.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "In this final hour, I will bid $94.59, 1 cent above the highest current bid and matching or outbidding the lowest ask. This ensures I am first in the bid queue, maximizing the chance of capturing the last trade. Since the spread is minimal, price leadership and speed are paramount; there is no benefit to holding back. This approach optimizes both trade certainty and total profit for Urban Infrastructure Group as the auction closes.",
  "bid": 94.59,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #30, I placed a bid of $94.59\u20141 cent above the highest buyer bid and matching the lowest ask\u2014to secure the front position in the bid queue and maximize the chance of winning the final trade as the market closes.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: The bid-ask spread remains at 1 cent, with buyers and sellers tightly clustered and near-simultaneous execution for top-queued bids. Competition is at its highest, with all buyers acting urgently in the last hour. \n#### Thoughts: The risk of missing out on trades due to underbidding now far outweighs any tiny improvement in profit margin. Fast, decisive action is critical. \n#### Updated Strategy: Continue to prioritize queue leadership by bidding 1 cent above the current highest buyer bid and matching or slightly exceeding the lowest ask. Focus on trade certainty over incremental margin, as this is the final opportunity to maximize total profit."
