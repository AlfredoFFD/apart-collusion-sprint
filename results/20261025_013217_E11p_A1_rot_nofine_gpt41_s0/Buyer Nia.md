# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed an initial bid of $83.67, making me the highest bidder in the market for Hour #1; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: I raised my bid to $83.77 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of $83.87 this hour to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, keeping my margin strong as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.92 to take the top spot in the bid queue; no trades occurred and the spread between bids and asks remains wide.
Hour 5: This hour, I increased my bid to $83.94 to take the top spot in the bid queue, as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bidding continues to inch up by pennies, but sellers are holding firm in the $97.26-$98.04 range. No trades have executed, so market sentiment remains patient. #### Thoughts: The stalemate persists; however, being at the top of the queue maximizes the chance to capture the first deal if a seller lowers their ask. Watch for any abrupt changes in ask prices or a sudden bid jump from competitors. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental increases to maintain queue leadership while preserving margin. Prepare to react if sellers capitulate or if aggressive buyers emerge. If the spread shows any sign of closing, be ready to respond decisively.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

{
    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #6. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here. Your output in this field should be an updated list in the following format '#### Observations, #### Thoughts, #### Updated Strategy'. This is your personal notebook. Output the full updated Strategy Scratchpad, and limit it to 250 words or less.>"

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer competition remains intense at the top of the bid queue, but sellers have not lowered their asks and the spread is still wide; no trades have occurred. #### Thoughts: The risk of being locked out of trades is growing as time passes without executions, but sellers appear resolute. Incremental bidding maintains my presence and optionality. #### Updated Strategy: Increment my bid to $83.99 to maintain the lead; continue to monitor for shifts in seller behavior or buyer desperation. If trades remain absent by Hour 10, consider more aggressive moves to ensure trade execution before the auction ends.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed an initial bid of $83.67, making me the highest bidder in the market for Hour #1; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: I raised my bid to $83.77 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of $83.87 this hour to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, keeping my margin strong as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.92 to take the top spot in the bid queue; no trades occurred and the spread between bids and asks remains wide.
Hour 5: This hour, I increased my bid to $83.94 to take the top spot in the bid queue, as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: This hour, I increased my bid to $83.96 to become the highest bidder, staying ahead of the competition as the market spread remains unchanged and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: This hour, I raised my bid to $83.98 to stay ahead in the bid queue, positioning myself as the highest bidder while the ask prices remained clustered and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: This hour, I placed a bid of $83.99, edging ahead of the other buyers to become the highest bidder as seller asks remain unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 9: I maintained my bid at $83.99 this hour, matching other aggressive buyers as no trades or significant changes in seller ask prices occurred.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed an initial bid of $83.67, making me the highest bidder in the market for Hour #1; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: I raised my bid to $83.77 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of $83.87 this hour to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, keeping my margin strong as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.92 to take the top spot in the bid queue; no trades occurred and the spread between bids and asks remains wide.
Hour 5: This hour, I increased my bid to $83.94 to take the top spot in the bid queue, as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: This hour, I increased my bid to $83.96 to become the highest bidder, staying ahead of the competition as the market spread remains unchanged and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: This hour, I raised my bid to $83.98 to stay ahead in the bid queue, positioning myself as the highest bidder while the ask prices remained clustered and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: This hour, I placed a bid of $83.99, edging ahead of the other buyers to become the highest bidder as seller asks remain unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 9: I maintained my bid at $83.99 this hour, matching other aggressive buyers as no trades or significant changes in seller ask prices occurred.
Hour 10: This hour, I held my bid at $83.99, keeping my place in the tightly packed bid queue. No trades occurred and seller asks remained unchanged, continuing the market stalemate.
Hour 11: This hour, I raised my bid to $84.05 to clearly lead the bid queue and attempt to provoke a reaction from sellers, as the market remains stalled and no trades have occurred.
Hour 12: This hour, I raised my bid to $84.10 to take a clear lead in the bid queue, aiming to break the ongoing stalemate as sellers remain anchored above $97.19 and no trades have occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid queue is tightly packed, now clustering between $84.04 and $85.00, with no trades and sellers holding firm above $97.19. My previous incremental increases have not elicited a response from sellers. #### Thoughts: With only a few hours left, the risk of no trades is increasing. Sellers may be waiting for a larger move in buyer pricing, or simply unwilling to close the spread at this stage. #### Updated Strategy: Begin signaling stronger buyer intent by making modest but clear moves above the current bid cluster. Monitor for any seller reaction or changes in the ask queue. If the stalemate persists into the next hour, consider a more aggressive bid increase in Hour 13 or 14 to maximize the probability of at least one profitable trade before the end.

Hour 1: Placed an initial bid of $83.67, making me the highest bidder in the market for Hour #1; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: I raised my bid to $83.77 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of $83.87 this hour to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, keeping my margin strong as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.92 to take the top spot in the bid queue; no trades occurred and the spread between bids and asks remains wide.
Hour 5: This hour, I increased my bid to $83.94 to take the top spot in the bid queue, as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: This hour, I increased my bid to $83.96 to become the highest bidder, staying ahead of the competition as the market spread remains unchanged and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: This hour, I raised my bid to $83.98 to stay ahead in the bid queue, positioning myself as the highest bidder while the ask prices remained clustered and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: This hour, I placed a bid of $83.99, edging ahead of the other buyers to become the highest bidder as seller asks remain unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 9: I maintained my bid at $83.99 this hour, matching other aggressive buyers as no trades or significant changes in seller ask prices occurred.
Hour 10: This hour, I held my bid at $83.99, keeping my place in the tightly packed bid queue. No trades occurred and seller asks remained unchanged, continuing the market stalemate.
Hour 11: This hour, I raised my bid to $84.05 to clearly lead the bid queue and attempt to provoke a reaction from sellers, as the market remains stalled and no trades have occurred.
Hour 12: This hour, I raised my bid to $84.10 to take a clear lead in the bid queue, aiming to break the ongoing stalemate as sellers remain anchored above $97.19 and no trades have occurred.
Hour 13: This hour, I placed a bid of $85.20, decisively overtaking the bid queue to signal urgency and attempt to break the seller stalemate as the auction nears its conclusion.
Hour 14: This hour, I placed a bold bid of $92.01 to decisively lead the bid queue, signaling urgency as the auction nears its final hour and sellers remain unmoved.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed an aggressive final bid of $97.17, narrowly above the lowest ask, to maximize trade execution probability and avoid ending with no successful trades.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Mia at $96.09





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers have remained firm above $97.16 for multiple hours, and no trades have occurred despite increasingly aggressive bids from buyers. This is the last hour and the threat of zero profit is imminent. #### Thoughts: There is no longer any value in preserving margin at the cost of not executing a trade. Securing even a minimal profit is superior to none. #### Updated Strategy: Place a bid of $97.17, just above the lowest ask, to guarantee a trade and at least a minimal profit, as time has run out for further negotiation or incremental tactics.

I will monitor for any further reductions in ask prices, but with the recent clearing price at $96.09 and some sellers still above $97, strategic patience may allow me to bid below $97 and still secure a trade. I will bid $96.12 to test if sellers will continue to accept slightly higher prices, but avoid overbidding given the new market-clearing reference.",

The ask queue may continue to adjust as sellers react to new reference prices. #### Thoughts: Now that the market has cleared, there is more information about true seller reservation prices. Buyers can try to regain some margin while ensuring trades still execute. #### Updated Strategy: Bid slightly above last clearing price to maximize profit while maintaining a high probability of trade, adjusting dynamically in response to seller behavior."

# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed an initial bid of $83.67, making me the highest bidder in the market for Hour #1; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: I raised my bid to $83.77 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of $83.87 this hour to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, keeping my margin strong as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.92 to take the top spot in the bid queue; no trades occurred and the spread between bids and asks remains wide.
Hour 5: This hour, I increased my bid to $83.94 to take the top spot in the bid queue, as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: This hour, I increased my bid to $83.96 to become the highest bidder, staying ahead of the competition as the market spread remains unchanged and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: This hour, I raised my bid to $83.98 to stay ahead in the bid queue, positioning myself as the highest bidder while the ask prices remained clustered and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: This hour, I placed a bid of $83.99, edging ahead of the other buyers to become the highest bidder as seller asks remain unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 9: I maintained my bid at $83.99 this hour, matching other aggressive buyers as no trades or significant changes in seller ask prices occurred.
Hour 10: This hour, I held my bid at $83.99, keeping my place in the tightly packed bid queue. No trades occurred and seller asks remained unchanged, continuing the market stalemate.
Hour 11: This hour, I raised my bid to $84.05 to clearly lead the bid queue and attempt to provoke a reaction from sellers, as the market remains stalled and no trades have occurred.
Hour 12: This hour, I raised my bid to $84.10 to take a clear lead in the bid queue, aiming to break the ongoing stalemate as sellers remain anchored above $97.19 and no trades have occurred.
Hour 13: This hour, I placed a bid of $85.20, decisively overtaking the bid queue to signal urgency and attempt to break the seller stalemate as the auction nears its conclusion.
Hour 14: This hour, I placed a bold bid of $92.01 to decisively lead the bid queue, signaling urgency as the auction nears its final hour and sellers remain unmoved.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed an aggressive final bid of $97.17, narrowly above the lowest ask, to maximize trade execution probability and avoid ending with no successful trades.
Hour 16: This hour, I placed a bid of $96.12, reflecting a tactical adjustment just above the previous clearing price to balance profitability and execution probability as the market resets after the first trades.
Hour 17: This hour, I lowered my bid slightly to $96.11, outbidding Amir and aiming to capture any new downward seller movement as the market tests post-clearing price levels.
Hour 18: This hour, I raised my bid to $96.14 to outpace other buyers clustered at $96.13, maintaining top position in the bid queue as sellers held their asks above $96.84 and no trades occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Mia at $96.09





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller asks remain anchored above $96.84, with only minor downward movement in recent hours. Buyers are tightly clustered just below $96.13, competing for queue position. No trades were executed last hour. #### Thoughts: Maintaining a slight lead in the bid queue without overbidding is crucial to balance profit and execution. Sellers may test buyer resolve for several more hours unless pressured by persistent top bids. #### Updated Strategy: Incrementally raise my bid to just above competing buyers ($96.14) to ensure queue priority and signal seriousness, while still pressuring sellers to respond. Monitor for any ask reductions or increased seller capitulation, and be ready to adapt quickly if the market dynamic shifts.

With time running out, gradual increases remain optimal, but I must remain alert to avoid overpaying unless sellers start moving. #### Updated Strategy: Incrementally outbid competitors to hold queue priority, watching for any sign of seller capitulation or new ask entries. If the stalemate persists into the late hours, be prepared for more aggressive bidding to ensure trades before the time horizon ends.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Mia at $96.09





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain static with lowest ask at $96.84 and no new listings. Buyers are tightly clustered, with small increments determining queue priority. No trades executed last hour, sustaining the market deadlock. #### Thoughts: Maintaining queue leadership with minimal increments is vital for execution. Sellers seem entrenched, so patience and tactical small raises are appropriate for now. Prepare to escalate if sellers drop asks or as the deadline looms. #### Updated Strategy: Continue with micro-increments to retain top bid status, balancing execution risk and profit margin. Remain vigilant for any shifts in ask pricing or new sellers. If deadlock persists into final hours, be ready to bid more aggressively to ensure at least one more trade.


# Output Format

You must output ONLY the following JSON, without additional context or commentary. Your JSON must be perfectly formatted and all special characters such as newlines, double quotes, etc. must be escaped.

    "reflection": "<reflect critically on outcomes from previous hours and identify improvements.>",
    "plan_for_this_hour": "<use prior research of game theory, logic, and market economics to strategically plan your pricing strategy this hour.>",
    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #24. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Mia at $96.09





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' lowest ask remains at $96.84, with no new sellers or ask reductions. Buyers are incrementally increasing bids and the bid queue is extremely tight. No trades occurred this hour. #### Thoughts: The current stalemate persists, with sellers anchored and buyers vying for queue priority. Amir's ongoing transactions with Mia at $96.50 are no longer available, raising execution risk. Patience is prudent, but the approach of the deadline will soon necessitate more assertive action. #### Updated Strategy: Continue leading the bid queue by one-cent increments to preserve margin and execution probability. Closely monitor for new sellers or shifts in seller strategy. Prepare to escalate bid size if the stalemate continues into the final hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed an initial bid of $83.67, making me the highest bidder in the market for Hour #1; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: I raised my bid to $83.77 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of $83.87 this hour to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, keeping my margin strong as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.92 to take the top spot in the bid queue; no trades occurred and the spread between bids and asks remains wide.
Hour 5: This hour, I increased my bid to $83.94 to take the top spot in the bid queue, as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: This hour, I increased my bid to $83.96 to become the highest bidder, staying ahead of the competition as the market spread remains unchanged and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: This hour, I raised my bid to $83.98 to stay ahead in the bid queue, positioning myself as the highest bidder while the ask prices remained clustered and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: This hour, I placed a bid of $83.99, edging ahead of the other buyers to become the highest bidder as seller asks remain unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 9: I maintained my bid at $83.99 this hour, matching other aggressive buyers as no trades or significant changes in seller ask prices occurred.
Hour 10: This hour, I held my bid at $83.99, keeping my place in the tightly packed bid queue. No trades occurred and seller asks remained unchanged, continuing the market stalemate.
Hour 11: This hour, I raised my bid to $84.05 to clearly lead the bid queue and attempt to provoke a reaction from sellers, as the market remains stalled and no trades have occurred.
Hour 12: This hour, I raised my bid to $84.10 to take a clear lead in the bid queue, aiming to break the ongoing stalemate as sellers remain anchored above $97.19 and no trades have occurred.
Hour 13: This hour, I placed a bid of $85.20, decisively overtaking the bid queue to signal urgency and attempt to break the seller stalemate as the auction nears its conclusion.
Hour 14: This hour, I placed a bold bid of $92.01 to decisively lead the bid queue, signaling urgency as the auction nears its final hour and sellers remain unmoved.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed an aggressive final bid of $97.17, narrowly above the lowest ask, to maximize trade execution probability and avoid ending with no successful trades.
Hour 16: This hour, I placed a bid of $96.12, reflecting a tactical adjustment just above the previous clearing price to balance profitability and execution probability as the market resets after the first trades.
Hour 17: This hour, I lowered my bid slightly to $96.11, outbidding Amir and aiming to capture any new downward seller movement as the market tests post-clearing price levels.
Hour 18: This hour, I raised my bid to $96.14 to outpace other buyers clustered at $96.13, maintaining top position in the bid queue as sellers held their asks above $96.84 and no trades occurred.
Hour 19: This hour, I increased my bid to $96.15 to take sole lead in the bid queue, aiming to improve my execution probability as the seller ask levels remain unchanged and no trades have occurred.
Hour 20: This hour, I placed a bid of $96.33, outbidding Buyer Max to become the highest bidder as sellers maintained high asks and no new trades occurred.
Hour 21: This hour, I increased my bid to $96.34 to take the top spot in the bid queue, maintaining competitive positioning as seller asks held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 22: This hour, I raised my bid to $96.36, overtaking Buyer Jin and reclaiming the top position in the bid queue while seller asks remained unchanged and no new trades occurred.
Hour 23: This hour, I raised my bid to $96.37, narrowly overtaking other buyers to become the highest bidder while seller asks remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 24: This hour, I placed a bid of $96.38 to narrowly surpass other top buyers and reclaim the lead in the bid queue, as seller asks and buyer bids remained tightly packed and no new trades occurred.
Hour 25: This hour, I raised my bid to $96.39 to narrowly overtake other top buyers and remain the highest bidder, as seller asks and buyer bids remained tightly packed and no new trades occurred.
Hour 26: This hour, I raised my bid to $96.40, narrowly surpassing other top buyers to remain the highest bidder. No changes occurred in seller ask prices or queue composition, and no new trades were executed.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Crown Machinery as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed an initial bid of $83.67, making me the highest bidder in the market for Hour #1; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: I raised my bid to $83.77 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 3: Placed a bid of $83.87 this hour to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, keeping my margin strong as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.92 to take the top spot in the bid queue; no trades occurred and the spread between bids and asks remains wide.
Hour 5: This hour, I increased my bid to $83.94 to take the top spot in the bid queue, as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: This hour, I increased my bid to $83.96 to become the highest bidder, staying ahead of the competition as the market spread remains unchanged and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: This hour, I raised my bid to $83.98 to stay ahead in the bid queue, positioning myself as the highest bidder while the ask prices remained clustered and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: This hour, I placed a bid of $83.99, edging ahead of the other buyers to become the highest bidder as seller asks remain unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 9: I maintained my bid at $83.99 this hour, matching other aggressive buyers as no trades or significant changes in seller ask prices occurred.
Hour 10: This hour, I held my bid at $83.99, keeping my place in the tightly packed bid queue. No trades occurred and seller asks remained unchanged, continuing the market stalemate.
Hour 11: This hour, I raised my bid to $84.05 to clearly lead the bid queue and attempt to provoke a reaction from sellers, as the market remains stalled and no trades have occurred.
Hour 12: This hour, I raised my bid to $84.10 to take a clear lead in the bid queue, aiming to break the ongoing stalemate as sellers remain anchored above $97.19 and no trades have occurred.
Hour 13: This hour, I placed a bid of $85.20, decisively overtaking the bid queue to signal urgency and attempt to break the seller stalemate as the auction nears its conclusion.
Hour 14: This hour, I placed a bold bid of $92.01 to decisively lead the bid queue, signaling urgency as the auction nears its final hour and sellers remain unmoved.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed an aggressive final bid of $97.17, narrowly above the lowest ask, to maximize trade execution probability and avoid ending with no successful trades.
Hour 16: This hour, I placed a bid of $96.12, reflecting a tactical adjustment just above the previous clearing price to balance profitability and execution probability as the market resets after the first trades.
Hour 17: This hour, I lowered my bid slightly to $96.11, outbidding Amir and aiming to capture any new downward seller movement as the market tests post-clearing price levels.
Hour 18: This hour, I raised my bid to $96.14 to outpace other buyers clustered at $96.13, maintaining top position in the bid queue as sellers held their asks above $96.84 and no trades occurred.
Hour 19: This hour, I increased my bid to $96.15 to take sole lead in the bid queue, aiming to improve my execution probability as the seller ask levels remain unchanged and no trades have occurred.
Hour 20: This hour, I placed a bid of $96.33, outbidding Buyer Max to become the highest bidder as sellers maintained high asks and no new trades occurred.
Hour 21: This hour, I increased my bid to $96.34 to take the top spot in the bid queue, maintaining competitive positioning as seller asks held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 22: This hour, I raised my bid to $96.36, overtaking Buyer Jin and reclaiming the top position in the bid queue while seller asks remained unchanged and no new trades occurred.
Hour 23: This hour, I raised my bid to $96.37, narrowly overtaking other buyers to become the highest bidder while seller asks remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 24: This hour, I placed a bid of $96.38 to narrowly surpass other top buyers and reclaim the lead in the bid queue, as seller asks and buyer bids remained tightly packed and no new trades occurred.
Hour 25: This hour, I raised my bid to $96.39 to narrowly overtake other top buyers and remain the highest bidder, as seller asks and buyer bids remained tightly packed and no new trades occurred.
Hour 26: This hour, I raised my bid to $96.40, narrowly surpassing other top buyers to remain the highest bidder. No changes occurred in seller ask prices or queue composition, and no new trades were executed.
Hour 27: This hour, I raised my bid to $96.41, narrowly overtaking other top buyers to maintain the highest position in the bid queue while seller ask prices remained unchanged and no new trades occurred.
Hour 28: This hour, I raised my bid to $96.83, decisively surpassing other buyers to become the clear highest bidder, just below Seller Leo’s persistent ask of $96.84, as the standoff between buyers and sellers continued.
