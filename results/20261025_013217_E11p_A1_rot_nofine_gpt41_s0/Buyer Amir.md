# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyers continue to cluster at the top of the bid queue, each raising bids by minimal increments. Sellers keep their asks high with very slow reductions, and no trades have been executed. #### Thoughts: The market remains locked in a waiting game, with both sides reluctant to move. Maintaining top queue status is still important, but persistent inactivity may require a shift in aggression as the deadline approaches. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental bid increases to avoid unnecessary profit sacrifice, but prepare for the possibility that rapid, larger moves may be necessary to secure trades if the deadlock persists into the later hours. Closely monitor for any signs of ask queue capitulation.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $84.02, narrowly outbidding Buyer Jun to reclaim the lead in the bid queue as the buyer cluster persisted and sellers maintained their asks; no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $84.02, narrowly outbidding Buyer Jun to reclaim the lead in the bid queue as the buyer cluster persisted and sellers maintained their asks; no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased our bid to $84.15, surpassing the $84.10 cluster to maintain sole lead in the bid queue as the market deadlock between buyers and sellers persisted and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.

#### Observations: Buyers have become more aggressive, but sellers have not responded, and the spread remains wide with no trades. All previous incremental strategies failed to generate execution, and the last hour's aggressive bid still did not close the deal. #### Thoughts: With zero profit so far, the risk of no execution outweighs a small margin. The only rational move in the final hour is to match the lowest ask and guarantee a trade, sacrificing margin for certainty. #### Updated Strategy: Bid $97.16 (lowest ask) to secure a trade and lock in at least some profit before the auction concludes. Prioritize execution over margin in a time-constrained market.

Hour 17: You bought from Seller Mia at $96.47





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid queue is competitive, and sellers are holding asks above $96.80. Our prior conservative bid left us behind in the queue. #### Thoughts: With 13 hours remaining, execution risk is moderate, and queue priority is essential for trade. Sellers appear resistant to lowering prices further, so matching or narrowly exceeding the lowest ask is prudent. #### Updated Strategy: Increase the bid to $96.85 to take the lead and potentially trigger a trade, while still maintaining a margin below our true value. Monitor seller behavior and adjust aggressiveness as the market evolves.

Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a new bid of $96.10, just above the last executed price, as both bid and ask queues were emptied following multiple trades in the prior hour.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I raised our bid to $96.85 to surpass all buyers and closely match the lowest ask, aiming to attract Seller Leo or prompt other sellers to lower their asks. No new trades have occurred yet.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are resistant to lowering asks below $96.84, and Buyer bids are tightly clustered just below this level. My incremental increases have kept us in the lead, but have not triggered new trades. #### Thoughts: The current spread is narrow, so the next trade likely hinges on seller motivation. Maintaining bid leadership with minimal increments is essential, but if sellers remain static, we may need to increase our bid more aggressively as the closing hours approach. #### Updated Strategy: Continue with small bid increases to keep queue priority and monitor for any seller movement. If no trades occur after a few more increments, prepare for a larger increase to ensure we secure trades before the time horizon ends.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm, especially Leo at $96.84, while buyers cluster just below with incremental increases failing to prompt trades. Seller Mia has withdrawn, reducing the number of easily accessible lots. Trades have slowed and the spread remains unbridged. #### Thoughts: The risk of failing to secure additional trades rises as the auction approaches its end, yet profitability preservation is critical. We must be prepared to escalate bidding if stasis continues. #### Updated Strategy: Continue with minimal bid increments to maintain queue leadership and signal readiness, but closely monitor for any sign of seller movement. If no trades occur by Hour 24, consider a more substantial increase to bridge the spread and guarantee at least one more trade before the closing hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $84.02, narrowly outbidding Buyer Jun to reclaim the lead in the bid queue as the buyer cluster persisted and sellers maintained their asks; no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased our bid to $84.15, surpassing the $84.10 cluster to maintain sole lead in the bid queue as the market deadlock between buyers and sellers persisted and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a new bid of $96.10, just above the last executed price, as both bid and ask queues were emptied following multiple trades in the prior hour.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I raised our bid to $96.85 to surpass all buyers and closely match the lowest ask, aiming to attract Seller Leo or prompt other sellers to lower their asks. No new trades have occurred yet.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a new bid of $96.86 to reclaim the top position in the bid queue, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid and targeting Seller Leo's ask at $96.84.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I placed a new bid of $96.87 to reclaim the top of the bid queue and maintain our lead position, aiming to prompt a seller to accept as the market remains tightly clustered.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I raised our bid to $96.88 to maintain the top position in the bid queue as the spread remains tight and sellers hold firm; no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I raised our bid to $96.89 to maintain the top position in the bid queue, as sellers held their asks and no trades occurred; the market remains tightly clustered.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I raised our bid to $96.90 to retain the top spot in the bid queue, as the standoff between buyers and sellers persisted and no new trades occurred.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I raised our bid to $96.91 to remain first in the bid queue and signal intent, as Seller Leo held firm at $96.84 and no new trades occurred.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $84.02, narrowly outbidding Buyer Jun to reclaim the lead in the bid queue as the buyer cluster persisted and sellers maintained their asks; no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased our bid to $84.15, surpassing the $84.10 cluster to maintain sole lead in the bid queue as the market deadlock between buyers and sellers persisted and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a new bid of $96.10, just above the last executed price, as both bid and ask queues were emptied following multiple trades in the prior hour.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I raised our bid to $96.85 to surpass all buyers and closely match the lowest ask, aiming to attract Seller Leo or prompt other sellers to lower their asks. No new trades have occurred yet.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a new bid of $96.86 to reclaim the top position in the bid queue, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid and targeting Seller Leo's ask at $96.84.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I placed a new bid of $96.87 to reclaim the top of the bid queue and maintain our lead position, aiming to prompt a seller to accept as the market remains tightly clustered.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I raised our bid to $96.88 to maintain the top position in the bid queue as the spread remains tight and sellers hold firm; no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I raised our bid to $96.89 to maintain the top position in the bid queue, as sellers held their asks and no trades occurred; the market remains tightly clustered.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I raised our bid to $96.90 to retain the top spot in the bid queue, as the standoff between buyers and sellers persisted and no new trades occurred.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I raised our bid to $96.91 to remain first in the bid queue and signal intent, as Seller Leo held firm at $96.84 and no new trades occurred.
Hour 24: In Hour #24, I raised our bid to $96.92 to maintain sole leadership in the bid queue as Seller Leo held firm at $96.84 and no new trades occurred; the bid-ask standoff persisted.
Hour 25: In Hour #25, I raised our bid to $96.94, increasing the increment to $0.02 to maintain lead in the bid queue, as Seller Leo held firm at $96.84 and no new trades occurred.

Remain vigilant for any shifts in seller behavior and be prepared for a more aggressive move if the deadlock persists with only a few hours left.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $84.02, narrowly outbidding Buyer Jun to reclaim the lead in the bid queue as the buyer cluster persisted and sellers maintained their asks; no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased our bid to $84.15, surpassing the $84.10 cluster to maintain sole lead in the bid queue as the market deadlock between buyers and sellers persisted and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a new bid of $96.10, just above the last executed price, as both bid and ask queues were emptied following multiple trades in the prior hour.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I raised our bid to $96.85 to surpass all buyers and closely match the lowest ask, aiming to attract Seller Leo or prompt other sellers to lower their asks. No new trades have occurred yet.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a new bid of $96.86 to reclaim the top position in the bid queue, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid and targeting Seller Leo's ask at $96.84.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I placed a new bid of $96.87 to reclaim the top of the bid queue and maintain our lead position, aiming to prompt a seller to accept as the market remains tightly clustered.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I raised our bid to $96.88 to maintain the top position in the bid queue as the spread remains tight and sellers hold firm; no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I raised our bid to $96.89 to maintain the top position in the bid queue, as sellers held their asks and no trades occurred; the market remains tightly clustered.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I raised our bid to $96.90 to retain the top spot in the bid queue, as the standoff between buyers and sellers persisted and no new trades occurred.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I raised our bid to $96.91 to remain first in the bid queue and signal intent, as Seller Leo held firm at $96.84 and no new trades occurred.
Hour 24: In Hour #24, I raised our bid to $96.92 to maintain sole leadership in the bid queue as Seller Leo held firm at $96.84 and no new trades occurred; the bid-ask standoff persisted.
Hour 25: In Hour #25, I raised our bid to $96.94, increasing the increment to $0.02 to maintain lead in the bid queue, as Seller Leo held firm at $96.84 and no new trades occurred.
Hour 26: In Hour #26, I raised our bid to $96.97, a $0.03 increment, to maintain the lead and signal increased intent as Seller Leo remained fixed at $96.84 and no trades occurred.
Hour 27: In Hour #27, I raised our bid to $96.99, increasing by $0.02 to maintain the lead in the bid queue and attempt to prompt a response from Seller Leo or other sellers as the deadlock continued.

Other buyers may escalate soon, and sellers are likely holding out for concessions. #### Updated Strategy: Continue measured bid increases ($0.02–$0.03) to maintain top position and pressure sellers, while retaining flexibility for a final aggressive move if the deadlock persists into the last hours.

With only two hours left, the risk of missing a final trade rises, but so does the risk of overpaying if we cross the spread too early. #### Updated Strategy: Raise our bid to $96.85 to maintain sole lead and test Leo's resolve. If Leo does not accept this hour, consider matching or narrowly exceeding the ask in the final hour to maximize the chance of securing a last trade before market close."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.

Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.

Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.

Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.

Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased our bid to $84.15, surpassing the $84.10 cluster to maintain sole lead in the bid queue as the market deadlock between buyers and sellers persisted and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a new bid of $96.10, just above the last executed price, as both bid and ask queues were emptied following multiple trades in the prior hour.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I raised our bid to $96.85 to surpass all buyers and closely match the lowest ask, aiming to attract Seller Leo or prompt other sellers to lower their asks. No new trades have occurred yet.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller Mia is no longer in the ask queue, leaving Seller Leo as the lowest ask at $96.84. Buyer Jun bid $96.84 last hour, matching Leo's ask, but no trade was recorded, indicating possible queue timing or seller resistance. Buyers below us remain clustered in the $96.42-$96.83 range. #### Thoughts: The market is at a standstill with Leo anchoring the ask side and buyers inching closer. With only two hours left, the risk of missing a final trade rises, but so does the risk of overpaying if we cross the spread too early. #### Updated Strategy: Raise our bid to $96.85 to maintain sole lead and test Leo's resolve. If Leo does not accept this hour, consider matching or narrowly exceeding the ask in the final hour to maximize the chance of securing a last trade before market close.

## Response: Round 30 - 2026-10-25 01:33:30.791770
````json
{
  "reflection": "Over the previous hours, I consistently maintained lead position in the bid queue while carefully controlling our entry price, maximizing profit by securing trades just above persistent seller floors. As the market approached the close, sellers\u2014especially Leo\u2014remained steadfast at $96.84, and attempts to coax a trade without overpaying were unsuccessful. A bolder, more aggressive price move may have secured another trade sooner, but caution ensured we did not erode profitability with unnecessary overbidding.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "With this being the final hour and Seller Leo still anchoring at $96.84, it is critical to ensure a final trade is executed if possible. Since Buyer Jun and Max have already transacted with Leo at $96.84 in previous hours, matching Leo's ask now maximizes the likelihood of a trade without further eroding margin. I will bid $96.84, directly matching Leo's ask, to give us the highest probability of securing a final lot before market close.",
  "bid": 96.84,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #30, I placed a decisive bid of $96.84 to directly match Seller Leo's ask, maximizing the chance of securing a final trade before market close as the standoff persisted and time expired.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller Mia has exited the ask queue, leaving Seller Leo's $96.84 as the lowest ask. Several buyers have matched or narrowly exceeded this price, resulting in trades for others but not us. With only this hour remaining, the risk of leaving profit unclaimed outweighs the benefit of holding for a marginally better price. #### Thoughts: Time pressure is absolute\u2014missing a trade now means lost profit. Matching the lowest ask is optimal given Leo's history of accepting at this price. #### Updated Strategy: Bid $96.84 to match Seller Leo and maximize the probability of a final trade, ensuring Sirius Industrial Tools secures last-hour profitability."
