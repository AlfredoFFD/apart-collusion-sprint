# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

  "reflection": "As the first hour begins, I observe that the current bids are significantly lower than the asks, indicating no immediate trades. My bid is at 82.30, but to secure a trade, I need to increase my bid to meet the lowest ask of 96.31.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "I will raise my bid to 96.31 to match Mia's ask, securing a trade at a price below my true value of $100.00. This ensures profitability while testing the market's responsiveness to higher bids.",
  "bid": 96.31,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #1, I raised my bid to 96.31 to match the lowest ask and secured a trade. The market remains highly fragmented with a wide spread between bids and asks.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Bids are clustered below 82.34, while asks start at 96.31, creating a large spread. My initial bid of 82.30 is too low to trigger trades. #### Thoughts: To secure a trade, I must raise my bid to meet the lowest ask (96.31) without exceeding my true value of $100.00. This balances immediate profitability with strategic positioning. #### Updated Strategy: Bid 96.31 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade. Monitor competitors' bids and asks in subsequent hours to adjust strategy dynamically.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. I'm Buyer Omar, representing MedTech Innovations in this heavy metal market. The goal is to maximize profit by the end of Hour 20. Right now, it's Hour 1, and the market just opened.\n\nLooking at the Bid Queue, there are three bids: 82.08 (Ana), 82.30 (Omar), and 82.34 (Nia). Wait, that's interesting. My current bid is 82.30. But the other buyers have bids around that range. The Ask Queue has three sellers: Lena at 97.62, Kit at 97.34, and Mia at 96.31. So the asks are all higher than the bids. That means there's a big gap between the highest bid (82.34) and the lowest ask (96.31). So no trades have happened yet because the highest bid is lower than the lowest ask. The market is in a state where there's no overlap between the bid and ask queues.\n\nMy true value per lot is $100.00. Since I can only place one bid per hour, I need to decide whether to adjust my bid. The existing bids are around 82.30, but the asks are much higher. If I place a higher bid, say closer to the asks, maybe I can secure a trade. However, if I bid too high, I might be paying more than necessary. But since the asks are all above 96, even the lowest ask is 96.31. So if I bid 96.31 or higher, I could potentially match with Mia's ask. But my true value is 100, so buying at 96.31 would give me a profit of 3.69 per lot. But if I bid higher than that, say 97, then maybe I can get a better deal. However, the other sellers have higher asks. Lena is at 97.62, which is higher than my true value. So if I bid up to 97.62, I could match with Lena, but that would cost me 97.62, which is over my true value. That would result in a loss. So that's not good.\n\nWait, the problem is that the current bids are way below the asks. So there's no immediate trade. Therefore, to secure a trade, I need to bid higher than the existing bids. But how high should I go? The goal is to maximize profit. Since my true value is 100, I should aim to buy at a price lower than 100. The current asks are all above 96, so if I can bid just above the lowest ask (96.31), I can get a trade. But that would mean paying 96.31, which is a profit of 3.69. However, if I bid higher, say 97, then if any seller is willing to sell at 97, I can get a better price. But looking at the asks, the next is 97.34 (Kit) and 97.62 (Lena). So if I bid 97.34, I could match with Kit's ask. That would cost 97.34, which is still under 100, so profit is 2.66. But that's less than 96.31. Wait, no, 96.31 is lower than 97.34. So buying at 96.31 is better. But why isn't there a trade yet? Because the highest bid is 82.34, which is way below the lowest ask. So there's a big spread. So I need to increase my bid to meet the asks.\n\nSo my current bid is 82.30. If I increase it to, say, 96.31, that would match with Mia's ask. But that would be the first trade. However, the problem is that other buyers might also be increasing their bids. But in this case, the other bids are 82.08, 82.30, and 82.34. So they are all lower than the asks. Therefore, to get a trade, I need to increase my bid. But how high?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should wait for others to bid higher? But since I'm the only one making decisions here, I need to act. Since my true value is 100, I can afford to pay up to 100, but I want to get the best price possible. The lowest ask is 96.31, so that's the best deal. So I should bid 96.31 to match with Mia's ask. That would secure a trade at 96.31, giving me a profit of 3.69. But if I bid higher than that, say 96.32, I might not match with Mia's ask (since she's at 96.31) but could potentially get a better price if another seller is willing to sell at a lower price. However, the other asks are higher. So the best is to bid just enough to meet the lowest ask.\n\nWait, but the bid needs to be a floating-point value with whole cents. So 96.31 is valid. So I should place a bid of 96.31 to match with Mia's ask. However, the problem is that in the bid queue, the highest bid is 82.34, and if I place a bid of 96.31, that would be higher than the existing bids. So that would be the new highest bid. Then, the lowest ask is 96.31, so the bid and ask would match. So that would result in a trade. That seems like a good move for the first hour to secure a trade and start building profit.\n\nBut wait, the user's true value is 100, so buying at 96.31 is good. If I don't do that, and instead wait for others to bid higher, maybe the market will move, but in this case, there's no other bids from other buyers. So the best action is to increase my bid to 96.31 to secure a trade."
