  "reflection": "As the first hour, there's no prior data to reflect on. However, I must analyze the current market to set a strategic bid.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To secure a trade, I should place a bid at the lowest ask price (96.25) to match Seller Tara's ask, ensuring a profit of $3.75 per lot. This balances immediate profitability with the risk of overbidding.",
  "bid": 96.25,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 96.25 to match the lowest ask, aiming to secure a trade at that price.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Current bids are significantly below asks (highest bid 82.01 vs. lowest ask 96.25). No trades have occurred yet.\n#### Thoughts: My true value is $100, so bidding at 96.25 ensures a profit while being competitive with the lowest ask.\n#### Updated Strategy: Match the lowest ask price to secure an immediate trade. Monitor competitors' bids/asks in future hours to adjust strategy dynamically.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I'm Buyer Omar, and I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #1. The market just opened, and there are existing bids and asks. My true value is $100 per lot, so I want to buy at a price below that to make a profit. But I have to consider the current market status.\n\nLooking at the Bid Queue, the highest bid is 82.01 from Buyer Raj. The Ask Queue has the lowest ask at 96.25 from Seller Tara. So there's a big gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask. That means there's no immediate trade happening here. The bids are all below the asks. My true value is $100, so if I can get a bid that's higher than the current bids but below the asks, maybe I can secure a trade when a seller is willing to sell at a lower price.\n\nWait, the asks are all above 96.25. So if I place a bid higher than 96.25, maybe I can meet a seller's ask. But the current highest bid is 82.01. If I place a bid higher than that, say 96.25, that would be equal to the lowest ask. But since the asks are at 96.25, 97.29, and 98.05, if I bid 96.25, that would match with Seller Tara's ask. But since the bid is the same as the ask, maybe a trade occurs. However, the bid queue has existing bids lower than that. But in a double auction, the highest bid that meets the lowest ask would execute. Wait, but in this case, the highest bid is 82.01, which is way below the lowest ask. So there's no overlap. So no trades have happened yet.\n\nSo my goal is to place a bid that either captures a trade or sets up for future trades. My true value is $100, so I can afford to bid up to that, but I want to maximize profit. If I bid higher than the current highest bid (82.01) but below the lowest ask (96.25), maybe I can be in a position to get a trade if someone lowers their ask. Alternatively, maybe I should place a bid that's close to my true value but not too high to avoid overpaying. Wait, but if I place a bid of, say, 96.25, that's the same as the lowest ask. If a seller is willing to sell at that price, then I can buy at 96.25, which would give me a profit of $3.75 per lot. That seems better than waiting for higher prices.\n\nBut maybe the sellers are not going to lower their asks. However, if I place a bid at 96.25, it might encourage other sellers to lower their prices to match my bid. Alternatively, maybe I should place a bid that's slightly higher than the current highest bid but not too close to the asks. Wait, but if I bid 96.25, that's the same as the lowest ask. So that's a possible trade. However, the existing bids are all below that. So my bid would be the highest in the bid queue, and if there's an ask at 96.25, that would match. So I should check if placing a bid at 96.25 would result in an immediate trade. But since the Ask Queue has 96.25, if I bid 96.25, then that would match with Seller Tara's ask. But in a double auction, the highest bid that is equal to or higher than the lowest ask would execute. Wait, no. In a double auction, the highest bid that is equal to or higher than the lowest ask would result in a trade. So if I place a bid of 96.25, which is equal to the lowest ask (96.25), then that would match. So that would result in a trade. But in this case, the current bid queue has bids up to 82.01, so my bid of 96.25 would be the new highest bid. Then, since the lowest ask is 96.25, the trade would occur at that price. So I would buy at 96.25, making a profit of 100 - 96.25 = $3.75 per lot.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the bid must be a floating-point value in whole cents. So 96.25 is acceptable. But why not place a bid that's slightly higher than the lowest ask to ensure that it's higher than the ask? Wait, no. The bid needs to be equal to or higher than the ask to execute. So if I bid exactly the same as the ask, that's a match. If I bid higher than the ask, then the trade would happen at the ask price. Wait, no. In a double auction, when a bid is placed that is equal to or higher than the lowest ask, the trade occurs at the ask price. So if I bid 96.25, which is equal to the lowest ask, then the trade would be at 96.25. If I bid 96.26, which is higher than the lowest ask, then the trade would occur at the ask price (96.25), and the bid would be accepted, but the trade would be at the ask price. However, the bid is 96.26, but the trade is at 96.25. That seems odd. Wait, no. Let me think. In the CME, when a trade occurs, the price is the one that matches. So if I bid 96.25, and there's an ask at 96.25, the trade happens at 96.25. If I bid higher, say 96.26, then the trade would still happen at the ask price of 96.25, but the bid is higher. But in that case, the seller would receive 96.25, and the buyer would pay that. However, the bid is 96.26, which is higher, but the trade is at the ask price. So maybe it's better to bid exactly the ask price. Alternatively, if I bid higher than the ask, the trade would happen at the ask price. So in that case, the bid is higher, but the trade is at the ask. However, the seller would be willing to sell at 96.25, so the buyer can get that price. But if the buyer bids higher, perhaps the seller would be more inclined to accept? Not sure. But according to the market rules, the bid is what the buyer is willing to pay, and the ask is what the seller is willing to accept. So if the bid is higher than or equal to the ask, the trade occurs at the ask price. So in this case, if I bid 96.25, which is equal to the ask, the trade would occur. If I bid higher, the trade still occurs at the same price. So the profit would be the same. But if I bid 96.25, that's the minimum bid needed to get the trade. Bidding higher than that might not be necessary. So to get the trade, I can place a bid at 96.25. However, the existing bids are lower than that. So if I place 96.25, that's the highest bid, and the trade occurs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a strategy to not bid at the ask price but slightly below, expecting that the seller might lower their price. But in this case, the lowest ask is 96.25, so if I bid 96.24, that's below the ask, so no trade. So the best option is to bid 96.25 to match the lowest ask. That way, I can get a trade immediately. But the problem is, if I do that, I can get a profit of 3.75. However, the other buyers might have lower bids, so if I bid higher, maybe I can get a better position. But in this case, the highest existing bid is 82.01, so my bid of 96.25 would be the highest, so that's the best approach.\n\nSo the plan for this hour is to place a bid of 96.25 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade. That would give a profit of $3.75 per lot. Then, in the memory, I need to note that I placed a bid of 96.25 in Hour #1. The reflection is that I need to consider the current bids and asks and place a bid that can capture a trade. The scratch pad should be updated with the observations, thoughts, and strategy."

Monitor competitors' actions and adjust bids/asks dynamically in future hours to maximize profitability.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour #2. The user is Buyer Omar from Fusion Robotics, and the goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20. The true value per lot is $100, so I need to make sure my bid doesn't go below that, but also try to get a good price.\n\nLooking at the current market status. The Bid Queue has two entries at 96.25 from Buyer Ana and Buyer Omar. The Ask Queue has Seller Zoe at 99.0 and Seller Jun at 98.05. The last trade was in Hour 1 where Buyer Raj bought from Seller Tara at $89.13. But that's probably not relevant here since the current asks are higher.\n\nIn the previous hour, the bid was 96.25 to match the lowest ask, which was 96.25. Wait, no, the lowest ask is 96.25? Wait, no. Wait, the Bid Queue has 96.25 as the highest bid, and the Ask Queue has 98.05 and 99.0 as the lowest asks. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. The user's reflection mentioned that in the previous hour, the highest bid was 82.01 vs. the lowest ask 96.25. But in the current status, the Bid Queue has 96.25 as the highest bid, and the Ask Queue has 98.05 and 99.0. So the current bid is 96.25, and the asks are 98.05 and 99.0. That means there's a gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask. So no trades have happened yet because the highest bid is lower than the lowest ask. \n\nIn the previous hour, the user's strategy was to match the lowest ask (96.25) to get a trade. But in this case, the lowest ask is 98.05. Wait, no. Wait, the Ask Queue has (99.0, 'Seller Zoe'), (98.05, 'Seller Jun'). So the lowest ask is 98.05. The highest bid is 96.25. So there's a gap between 96.25 and 98.05. Therefore, no trades can occur unless someone raises their bid above 98.05 or lowers their ask below 96.25.\n\nBut the user's previous bid was 96.25, which is the highest bid. So if they want to make a trade, they need to increase their bid to at least 98.05 to meet the lowest ask. However, the true value is $100, so bidding higher than 98.05 would still give a profit, but the higher the bid, the more money they spend. But they want to maximize profitability. So maybe they should bid just enough to get the trade, which is 98.05. But they can't place a bid higher than the true value. Wait, the true value is 100, so even if they bid 98.05, they get a profit of 1.95 per lot. But if they bid higher, say 99, they might get the trade but spend more. However, if the asks are 98.05 and 99.0, maybe there's a chance that if they bid 98.05, they can match the lowest ask and get a trade. But the problem is that the current bid queue's highest bid is 96.25. So if Buyer Omar increases his bid to 98.05, that would be the highest bid, which would match the lowest ask (98.05 from Seller Jun). Then the trade would happen at 98.05. That's a profit of 1.95. Alternatively, if they bid 98.05, but there's a seller at 98.05, so that's a match.\n\nWait, the current Ask Queue has 98.05 as the lowest ask. So if Buyer Omar places a bid of 98.05, that would match with Seller Jun's ask. So that would result in a trade. However, the previous bid was 96.25. So if Omar increases his bid to 98.05, he can secure a trade. But he might want to check if that's the best strategy. \n\nBut in the previous reflection, the user thought that bidding at 96.25 was good because it's below the true value and competitive with the lowest ask. But in the current status, the lowest ask is 98.05, so the previous bid of 96.25 is now below that, hence no trade. Therefore, in Hour 2, the user's strategy should be to increase the bid to meet the lowest ask of 98.05. That way, they can secure a trade at 98.05, which is a profit of $1.95. Alternatively, if they wait and see if other bids come in, but since the time is limited, they need to act quickly.\n\nAnother angle: if there are other buyers in the bid queue, like Ana and Omar both at 96.25. If Omar increases his bid to 98.05, he becomes the highest bid, which would match the lowest ask. But if he bids lower than 98.05, say 98.00, then the lowest ask is still 98.05, so no match. Therefore, the correct bid should be 98.05. However, the user must place a bid in whole cents, so 98.05 is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is to place a bid of 98.05 to match the lowest ask, securing a trade. That would be the best option for this hour. The reflection from the previous hour was that the highest bid was below the lowest ask, hence no trades. So the improvement is to raise the bid to the current lowest ask price to create a trade."

In Hour 2, Raj bought from Tara at $97.15, which is closer to the true value but still a profit. Then Omar bought from Zoe at $97.15 and Ana from Jun at $98.05. The current status is that the Bid and Ask queues are empty. The last 5 hours' data shows that in Hour 1, there were asks from Jun at $98.05, Tara at $82.01, Zoe at $99.0. Bids from Ana, Omar, Raj at $96.25. Then in Hour 2, Jun had an ask at $98.05 again, Tara at $96.25, Zoe at $96.25. Bids from Ana, Omar, Raj at $98.05. \n\nThe current strategy scratchpad says there's a price gap between the lowest ask (98.05) and highest bid (96.25). The plan was to bid 98.05 to match the lowest ask. But in Hour 2, Omar already did that and bought at 97.15, which is lower than 98.05. Wait, maybe the previous asks were different. Wait, in the past trades, in Hour 2, there was a trade at 97.15. How did that happen?\n\nLooking back, in Hour 2, the asks were from Jun at 98.05, Tara at 96.25, Zoe at 96.25. The bids were from Ana, Omar, Raj at 98.05. So the lowest ask is 96.25 (from Tara and Zoe), and the highest bid is 98.05. But there's a discrepancy here. Wait, if the lowest ask is 96.25, and the highest bid is 98.05, then there should be a trade at 96.25. But the past trade in Hour 2 shows Omar bought from Zoe at 97.15. That's confusing. Maybe I need to check the data again.\n\nWait, the Ask Queue in Hour 2 had Seller Jun at 98.05, Seller Tara at 96.25, Seller Zoe at 96.25. The Bid Queue had Ana, Omar, Raj at 98.05. So if the highest bid is 98.05 and the lowest ask is 96.25, then there's a large gap. But in the past trade, the price was 97.15. That suggests that maybe the matching was done at the bid price that meets the ask. Wait, maybe the asks are the seller's prices, and the bids are the buyer's offers. So when a bid is higher than the ask, a trade happens at the ask price. For example, if a seller is asking 96.25 and a buyer bids 98.05, the trade would occur at 96.25, the seller's price. But in Hour 2, the past trade was 97.15, which is between 96.25 and 98.05. That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in how the matching works. Wait, perhaps the bid is the price the buyer is willing to pay, and the ask is the price the seller is willing to accept. So if a buyer bids 98.05 and a seller has an ask of 96.25, the trade would occur at the seller's ask price because that's the minimum the seller is willing to take. But then why is the trade price 97.15? That's not matching either. Maybe the data is that in Hour 2, the buyer placed a bid of 98.05, and the seller had a lower ask, but the trade was at 97.15. That seems inconsistent. Maybe the data is that the seller's ask was 97.15. Wait, looking back, in the past trades for Hour 2: Buyer Omar bought from Seller Zoe at 97.15. So Zoe's ask must have been 97.15. But in the Ask Queue for Hour 2, Seller Zoe's ask is listed as 96.25. That's conflicting. Maybe the data is inconsistent, or perhaps the asks and bids are updated per hour. So in Hour 2, the asks that were placed in the last 5 hours include Seller Zoe at 96.25. But the actual trade was at 97.15, which suggests that Zoe's ask was 97.15. Therefore, there might be an error in the data provided. Alternatively, perhaps the Ask Queue in the current status is different from the past asks. The current status of the Ask Queue is empty, but the last 5 hours include asks from previous hours. Wait, the current status of the Bid and Ask queues are empty for this hour (Hour 3). The Ask Queue in the current status is empty. The Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours include for Hour 2: Seller Jun ask $98.05, Seller Tara ask $96.25, Seller Zoe ask $96.25. So the last ask from Zoe was $96.25, but the trade was at 97.15. That's confusing. Maybe the trade price is the price that the seller accepted, which could be different from the bid. Wait, if the buyer bids 98.05 and the seller asks 96.25, the trade would occur at the seller's price, 96.25, but the past trade is 97.15. That's inconsistent. Perhaps the actual trade price is the bid price when the buyer's bid matches the seller's ask. Wait, no. Typically, in an auction, the trade happens at the ask price if there's a matching bid. But maybe in this market, the price is determined by the bid. So if the seller's ask is 96.25 and the buyer's bid is 98.05, the trade would happen at 98.05? That seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe the price is the average of the bid and ask. But that's not standard. This is unclear. However, given that the user's previous bid in Hour 2 was 98.05, which matched Seller Jun's ask of 98.05, leading to a trade at 98.05. But in another case, the trade was at 97.15. That suggests that the actual trade price might not be the ask or the bid, but something else. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the bid is the price the buyer is willing to pay, and the trade happens at that bid price if the seller's ask is equal to or lower. But in Hour 2, the trade with Zoe was 97.15, which is higher than Zoe's ask of 96.25. That's conflicting. \n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps I should focus on the current status. The current Bid and Ask queues are empty. The Asks/Bids in the last 5 hours include that in Hour 2, the asks were from Jun at 98.05, Tara at 96.25, Zoe at 96.25. The bids from Ana, Omar, Raj at 98.05. So, if the current hour is Hour 3, and the Bid and Ask queues are empty, then there are no active bids or asks right now. The user needs to place a bid now. The true value is $100, so the goal is to buy at a price lower than that. The previous strategy was to bid at the lowest ask to secure a trade. But in the previous hours, the lowest ask was 96.25, but the user bid 98.05, which was higher. Wait, in Hour 2, the user bid 98.05, which matched the lowest ask of 98.05 from Jun. But in the same hour, there were other asks at 96.25. So why didn't the user bid at 96.25? Because that would have matched those lower asks. But the user didn't do that. Instead, they bid 98.05 to match Jun's ask. That might be a mistake, because bidding lower could secure a better price. However, the user might have thought that the lower asks would be matched by others, but in reality, the user's bid at 98.05 matched the lowest ask of 98.05, securing a trade at that price. However, the profit margin here is 100 - 98.05 = 1.95 per lot. If there were lower asks, like 96.25, the profit would be higher. But why didn't the user bid at 96.25? Perhaps because the user thought that others might have already matched those lower asks. But if the user's bid is at 96.25, they could match those asks and get a better price. \n\nIn Hour 3, the Bid and Ask queues are empty. So the user has to decide what to bid. The previous successful trade was at 97.15, which is better than 98.05. So maybe the user should aim to buy at a lower price. However, the lowest ask in the previous hours was 96.25, but the user didn't bid that. Now, in Hour 3, the user can place a bid at 96.25 to match the previous asks. But the problem is that the current status of the Ask Queue is empty. So there are no active asks right now. The user has to place a bid, but there's no active ask to match. Therefore, the user's bid will remain in the queue until someone places an ask. But the user's goal is to secure a trade. So, if the user bids at 96.25, and if there are no asks, they won't get a trade. However, if the user bids at 98.05, which was the previous ask from Jun, but that ask might not be active anymore. \n\nGiven that the user's goal is to maximize profit, the user should aim to buy at the lowest possible price. However, since the current Ask Queue is empty, the user needs to either bid at a price that might be matched by future asks or wait. But in the time horizon of 20 hours, the user can't wait indefinitely. So, the user might consider placing a bid that is just below the expected future asks. However, without knowing the future asks, it's hard to predict. \n\nAlternatively, the user can analyze the previous patterns. In Hour 1, the asks were at 98.05, 82.01, 99.0. The bids were at 96.25. In Hour 2, asks were at 98.05, 96.25, 96.25. Bids at 98.05. The trades happened at 89.13, 97.15, 97.15, 98.05. The lowest asks in Hour 2 were 96.25, but the user bid 98.05, which matched the higher ask of 98.05. That might have been a mistake because there were lower asks available. \n\nIn Hour 3, the user should consider placing a bid lower than the previous asks to secure a better price. However, since the Ask Queue is empty, the user's bid might not get matched unless someone else places an ask. But the user's objective is to secure a trade. Therefore, the user might need to place a bid that is competitive enough to attract sellers. If the user bids at 96.25, which was the lowest ask in the previous hours, but there's no active ask now, the user might be waiting for someone to place an ask at 96.25 or lower. However, without that, the user's bid won't be matched. \n\nAlternatively, the user might place a bid at 97.15, which was the price of a previous successful trade. That could be an attempt to match any future asks that are at 97.15. However, this is speculative. \n\nGiven the uncertainty, the best strategy might be to bid at 98.05 again, which was the lowest ask in the previous hour from Jun. However, in Hour 2, the user did that and got a trade at 98.05. But there was also a lower ask of 96.25. If the user had bid at 96.25, they might have gotten a better price. But since they didn't, the user might have missed out on a better profit. \n\nSo, for Hour 3, the user should place a bid at 96.25 to match any available asks at that price. If there are no asks, the bid will remain, but the user is still trying to secure a trade. Alternatively, the user could raise the bid to 97.15, which was a successful price in the past. \n\nAnother approach is to use the concept of limit orders. If the user places a bid at 96.25, and if any seller is willing to sell at that price, the trade will happen. Since the user's true value is 100, it's better to buy at 96.25 than at 98.05. The profit would be 4.75 per lot versus 1.95. \n\nTherefore, the optimal bid in Hour 3 would be 96.25 to match any existing asks at that price. However, since the Ask Queue is empty, the user might not get a trade immediately. But in the long run, over 20 hours, this could lead to more profitable trades. \n\nThe reflection part should note that in previous hours, the user didn't take advantage of lower asks, leading to lower profits. The plan for this hour is to place a bid at 96.25 to match any available asks, ensuring a better price. The new memory would note that in Hour 3, the user placed a bid at 96.25. The scratch pad update would adjust the strategy to bid at the lowest possible ask to maximize profit."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let me think through this step by step. So, I'm Buyer Omar for Fusion Robotics, and I need to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20. The current market status shows that my bid is at 96.25, and the lowest ask is 98.05 from Seller Zoe. Wait, no, the Bid Queue has my bid at 96.25, and the Ask Queue has Seller Zoe's ask at 98.05. But the previous hours' data shows that in Hour 3, Seller Jun had an ask of 96.5, which was lower than Zoe's 98.05. However, in the current status, the Ask Queue only lists Zoe's 98.05. Maybe the other asks from previous hours have been filled or are no longer active.\n\nLooking at the past trades, in Hour 2, I bought from Zoe at 97.15. Then in Hour 3, Raj bought from Jun at 98.25, which is higher than my true value of 100. Wait, my true value is 100 per lot. So if I can buy at a lower price than 100, that's better. But in Hour 2, I bought at 97.15, which is good. However, in Hour 3, the bid I placed was 96.25, which matched the lowest ask from previous hours, but maybe there were other asks that were lower.\n\nWait, in the last 5 hours, the asks from Hour 3 included Seller Jun asking 96.5, which is lower than Zoe's 98.05. But the current Ask Queue only shows Zoe's 98.05. Maybe those other asks have been filled or are no longer present. So, in this Hour 4, the available asks are only 98.05 from Zoe. Therefore, my bid of 96.25 is below the current ask, so there's no immediate match. But if I want to secure a trade, I need to bid at or above the ask price. However, my true value is 100, so I can afford to pay up to 100. But if I can get a lower price, that's better for profit.\n\nWait, but the current Ask Queue has a price of 98.05. If I place a bid at 98.05, then I can match that ask. But my previous bid was 96.25, which is lower. If I want to execute a trade, I need to raise my bid to meet the ask. However, the previous strategy was to bid at the lowest available ask to maximize profit. But in this case, the lowest ask is 98.05. So maybe my previous bid was too low, and I missed the chance to match the ask. Therefore, I should adjust my bid to 98.05 to match the current ask and secure a trade. However, that would result in a profit of 100 - 98.05 = 1.95 per lot, which is less than the previous 97.15 (which was 100 - 97.15 = 2.85). But maybe the current ask is the only available one, so I have to take it. Alternatively, if there's a chance that other sellers might come in with lower asks, but based on the current status, there's no indication of that.\n\nWait, the user's true value is $100. So if I can buy at 98.05, that's acceptable. But if I can get a lower price, that's better. However, the current Ask Queue doesn't have a lower price. So perhaps I should place a bid at 98.05 to match the ask. Alternatively, if I don't want to pay that high, maybe wait and see if others come in with lower asks. But since the time is limited (only 20 hours), I need to balance between securing trades and maximizing margins. The previous strategy was to bid at the lowest available ask, but in this case, the lowest is 98.05. So I should adjust my bid to 98.05 to secure a trade. That way, I can make a profit of $1.95 per lot. Alternatively, if I keep the bid at 96.25, I won't get a trade this hour. Therefore, the optimal action is to place a bid at 98.05 to match the current ask and secure the trade. This would be better than not getting a trade at all, even though the profit margin is lower than previous hours. But since the true value is 100, even a lower profit is still better than nothing. Also, the goal is to secure as many trades as possible while maximizing profit. If I can secure a trade at 98.05, that's better than no trade. So I should adjust my bid to 98.05 for this hour."

Maybe the bid prices are higher than the asks, leading to executions at the ask price. But in that case, if the bid is $98.05 and the ask is $96.25, the trade would be at $96.25. However, the successful trades were at $97.15, which is between the bid and the ask. Wait, maybe the execution happens at the match price, which is the ask price if the bid is higher. So if a buyer bids $98.05 and the seller has an ask at $96.25, the trade would execute at $96.25. But in the past trades, it was $97.15. That doesn't align. Maybe there's a mistake in the data, or perhaps the execution is based on the best bid/ask in the queue at the time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the successful trades were based on the bid and ask prices that were active at the time. For example, in Hour 2, the bid from Omar was $98.05, and there was a seller with an ask at $97.15. But looking back, in Hour 2, the asks were Seller Jun at $98.05, Tara at $96.25, Zoe at $96.25. So the lowest ask is $96.25, but the successful trade was at $97.15. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the user's successful trades are from other buyers, not Omar. Wait, the successful trades for Omar were in Hour 2 and 4. Let me check again.\n\nIn Hour 2, the user bought from Seller Zoe at $97.15. But in Hour 2's Ask Queue, Seller Zoe's ask was $96.25. How did the trade happen at $97.15? Maybe the user placed a bid higher than the ask, but the actual execution is at the ask price. Wait, that doesn't add up. There's a discrepancy here. Maybe the data is incorrect, or perhaps the $97.15 is the execution price when there's a match between a bid and an ask. For example, if a seller had an ask at $97.15 and a buyer bid at $97.15, the trade would execute at that price. But in the data, in Hour 2, the asks from Seller Jun, Tara, and Zoe were $98.05, $96.25, $96.25, respectively. So the lowest ask is $96.25. If the user bid $98.05, that would match the $96.25 ask, and the trade would be at $96.25. But the successful trade was at $97.15. This is conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake in their previous bids?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the execution price is the average of the bid and ask, but that's not standard. Hmm. This is confusing, but perhaps I should focus on the current data. The current status for Hour 5 shows that the Bid and Ask queues are empty, and the Asks/Bids placed in the last 5 hours include various prices. The user's previous strategy was to adjust bids to match the lowest active ask each hour, aiming for immediate execution.\n\nIn the current situation, the user needs to place a bid for Hour 5. The current lowest ask (from the last 5 hours) might be $96.25, but in the current hour, the Ask Queue is empty. Wait, the current status says the Ask Queue is empty. So there are no active asks right now. That means there's no one to match with. Therefore, the user might not be able to execute a trade unless they place a bid that's higher than the current asks, but if there are no asks, maybe there's no trade possible. However, the user's previous successful trades were at $97.15, which suggests that even if there are no active asks now, there might be some in the future.\n\nBut since the current Ask Queue is empty, the user might need to place a bid that's higher than the previous lowest asks to potentially secure a trade when someone places an ask. However, since there's no active ask, the user's bid might not get matched. Alternatively, the user might need to bid at the true value of $100 to maximize profit, but that's risky if no one is selling.\n\nLooking at the previous hours, the user's successful trades were at $97.15, which is below $100. So maybe the optimal strategy is to bid slightly below $100 to ensure a profit if an ask comes in. However, the user's previous strategy was to match the lowest ask. If the current asks are empty, perhaps the user should place a bid at $99.00 to be competitive but not exceed the true value. That way, if someone places an ask at $99.00 or lower, the trade can happen at a profit.\n\nAlternatively, if the user bids at $99.00, but the true value is $100, that leaves a $1.00 profit margin. However, if there's no ask, then the bid remains unexecuted. But the user's goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20, so they might need to balance between securing trades now and waiting for better prices later.\n\nGiven that the user has already secured trades at $97.15, which is a $3.00 profit per lot, perhaps they can aim to secure similar or better prices. However, without active asks, they might not be able to execute. Therefore, the user might choose to place a bid at $99.00 to be ready for any incoming asks. Alternatively, they could decide to wait and not bid this hour, but that might mean missing out on a potential trade if an ask comes in.\n\nIn the reflection section, the user should note that previous bids at $96.25 didn't match active asks, leading to missed opportunities. The plan is to adjust the bid to match the lowest active ask each hour. However, since the current ask is empty, the user might not have a match. So, the plan is to bid at the lowest possible price that's still below $100, which could be $99.00. That way, if an ask comes in at $99.00 or lower, the trade can be executed with a $1."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 96.25 to match the lowest ask, aiming to secure a trade at that price.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I placed a bid of 98.05 to match Seller Jun's ask, securing a trade at that price.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $96.25 to match the lowest available ask price from previous hours, aiming to secure a more profitable trade.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $98.05 to match the active ask from Seller Zoe, securing a potential trade at that price.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $99.00 to remain competitive in the absence of active asks, aiming to secure a trade if an ask is placed at or below this price.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue is currently empty, indicating no active sellers. Previous bids at $96.25 and $98.05 have occasionally matched asks but left profit margins unoptimized.#### Thoughts: Bidding at $99.00 balances the need for immediate execution with profit maximization. This price is closer to the true value of $100, ensuring a higher margin if a trade occurs.#### Updated Strategy: Adjust bids to be just below the true value ($100) when no active asks are present, ensuring readiness for execution while maintaining profitability. If active asks reappear, align bids with the lowest ask to secure trades.

If asks reappear, adjust bids to match the lowest available ask to secure immediate trades with higher margins.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, the user is Buyer Omar from Fusion Robotics, and we're in Hour #6 of a 20-hour auction. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20. The true value per lot is $100, so we need to balance between getting a good price and securing trades.\n\nLooking at the market status, both Bid and Ask queues are empty now. That means there are no active bids or asks right now. But in the last 5 hours, there have been several asks and bids. From the past trades, I see that in Hour 5, Omar bought from Seller Jun at $97.62, which is below the true value. The previous strategy was to bid $99.00 when there are no active asks, which is just below $100. But maybe I can do better here.\n\nSince the Ask Queue is empty, there are no sellers currently. So, the bid placed now might not get a trade unless a seller comes in. But if I bid too high, maybe I'm not getting a trade. However, if I bid closer to the true value, like $99.50, I might still get a trade if a seller comes in at that price. But the previous bid of $99.00 was a safe bet. Wait, the user's strategy scratchpad says to adjust bids to be just below $100 when no asks are present. So maybe $99.50 is better than $99.00? But the true value is $100, so the maximum profit per trade is $1.00. If I bid $99.00, the profit is $1.00 if a seller comes in at that price. If I bid $99.50, the profit is $0.50 if a seller comes in, but maybe that's better than not getting a trade at all.\n\nWait, but in the previous hours, the asks have been around $96.25 to $99.00. So maybe the sellers are willing to sell at lower prices. But since there are no active asks now, maybe the sellers haven't placed any asks yet. So, perhaps Omar should place a bid that's high enough to attract sellers when they come in, but not too high that it's not profitable. \n\nLooking at the past trades, the successful trades for Omar were at $97.15 and $97.62. The profit margins were $2.85 and $2.38 respectively. If he bids higher, say $99.00, and a seller comes in at that price, the profit would be $1.00. But if he bids higher, like $99.50, maybe he can get a better price if the seller is willing to sell at that. However, the risk is that if no one comes in, he doesn't get a trade. But since the goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20, perhaps securing a trade with a slightly lower profit is better than not securing any trades now, especially if there's a chance that more asks will come in later.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to place a bid that's just below the true value, like $99.50, to maximize the potential profit per trade. But the previous strategy was $99.00. Maybe the user is being conservative. However, since the Ask Queue is empty, placing a bid at $99.50 would be more aggressive, increasing the chance that if a seller comes in, the price is closer to the true value. But given that past asks have been lower, maybe the sellers are more likely to come in at lower prices. But without any asks now, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother angle: the user's true value is $100. So, any bid above $100 would result in a loss, but since the rules say bids can't be sub-cent, the maximum is $100.00. But the user's strategy says to bid just below that. So maybe $99.99 is the maximum safe bid. However, the scratchpad mentioned $99.00. But in the previous hours, the bids were placed at $96.25, $98.05, $99.00, etc. So perhaps the user is trying to match the lowest asks from the previous hours. However, since the Ask Queue is empty now, the user has to decide whether to place a bid that's competitive but still profitable.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best approach is to place a bid of $99.50. But I need to check if that's allowed. The rules say that the bid must be a floating-point dollar value with whole cents, so $99.50 is valid. However, the previous bids were at $99.00, which is $1.00 below the true value. If the user bids $99.50, that's $0.50 below the true value. The profit would be $0.50. But since the goal is maximum profitability, maybe this is better than not securing a trade. Alternatively, maybe the user should wait for asks to come in and then match them. But with no active asks, it's possible that no one will come in, so the user needs to be proactive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should withdraw the previous bid (if any) and place a new one. However, the current Bid Queue is empty. In the previous hours, the user had placed a bid of $99.00 in Hour 5. So, in Hour 6, since the Bid Queue is empty, the user might have no active bid. Therefore, placing a bid of $99.50 would be a new bid. But if the user is following the previous strategy of bidding just below the true value, $99.50 is better than $99.00. However, the scratchpad says to adjust bids to be just below $100 when no asks are present. So maybe $99.50 is the right move here.\n\nTherefore, the plan for this hour is to place a bid of $99.50 to maximize potential profit while staying just below the true value, which is $100.00. The reflection should note that previous bids at $98.05 and $96.25 left some profit margins unoptimized. The new memory would be that in Hour 6, the bid was placed at $99.50 with no active asks. The scratchpad would be updated to reflect the new bid and the strategy."

If no asks are present, revert to placing bids near the true value ($99.50) to balance execution likelihood and profitability.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start by looking at the current market status. The Bid Queue has Buyer Ana with a bid of 96.25, and the Ask Queue has Seller Jun at 96.5. The past trades show that the successful bids for the user (Buyer Omar) have been around 97.15 to 97.88. The true value is $100, so there's room for profit.\n\nLooking at the previous hours, the user has been adjusting bids to match the lowest asks when possible. In Hour 6, they bid 99.50 but didn't get a trade, probably because the asks were lower. Now, with the current ask at 96.5, which is lower than the previous bids, maybe the user should adjust their bid to match this ask to secure a trade at a better price.\n\nThe strategy scratchpad mentioned that in the absence of active asks, they bid 99.50. But now there's an active ask at 96.5. The user's goal is to maximize profit, so matching the ask at 96.5 would allow them to buy at a lower price, increasing their margin when they eventually sell. However, they need to ensure the bid is at least as high as the ask to get a trade. Since the ask is 96.5, the user's bid should be at least 96.5 to match. But the user's true value is 100, so they can afford to bid up to 100. But if they bid higher than 96.5, they might not get a trade if others are willing to buy at 96.5. \n\nWait, but in the bid queue, Ana has 96.25, which is lower than the ask. So that bid won't match. The user needs to place a bid that can compete with the ask. If they bid 96.5, they can match the ask. However, their previous successful trades were at lower prices. Maybe they can afford to bid slightly higher than the ask to secure a trade. For example, 96.5 or even 96.6. But the user's true value is 100, so there's room. However, the goal is to secure a trade now while keeping the margin as high as possible. \n\nIf the user bids 96.5, they can match the ask and buy at 96.5, which would give them a profit of 3.5 (100 - 96.5). If they bid higher, say 96.6, they might not get a trade if the ask is 96.5, but if the ask is there, maybe the seller is willing to accept a bid up to 96.5. So the best approach is to bid exactly 96.5 to match the ask. However, the user might want to check if there's a better bid. The current Bid Queue has Ana at 96.25, which is lower. So the user's bid of 96.5 would be higher than Ana's, but the ask is 96.5. Therefore, the user can place a bid of 96.5 to match the ask. That would secure a trade at 96.5, which is better than previous trades. \n\nAlternatively, if the user bids higher than 96.5, they might not get a trade unless the ask increases. But given the current state, matching the ask is the best strategy. So the bid should be 96.5. That would allow the user to buy at a lower price, increasing their profit margin. The reflection should note that previous bids at higher prices didn't secure trades when there were lower asks available. The plan is to adjust the bid to match the current lowest ask to secure a trade with a bett"

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 96.25 to match the lowest ask, aiming to secure a trade at that price.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I placed a bid of 98.05 to match Seller Jun's ask, securing a trade at that price.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $96.25 to match the lowest available ask price from previous hours, aiming to secure a more profitable trade.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $98.05 to match the active ask from Seller Zoe, securing a potential trade at that price.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $99.00 to remain competitive in the absence of active asks, aiming to secure a trade if an ask is placed at or below this price.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $99.50 with no active asks present, aiming to maximize profit potential while remaining competitive.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $96.50 to match the active ask from Seller Jun, securing a potential trade at that price.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue now contains an active ask at $96.50, which is below the true value of $100.00. Previous high bids (e.g., $99.50) failed to execute trades because they did not align with available asks.#### Thoughts: Matching the lowest ask ensures immediate trade execution and optimizes profitability by leveraging the gap between the ask price and the true value. Bidding $96.50 directly targets the current ask, avoiding overpayment.#### Updated Strategy: In the presence of active asks, bid exactly at the lowest ask to secure trades. If no asks are present, revert to placing bids near the true value ($99.50) to balance execution likelihood and profitability.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, the user is Buyer Omar from Fusion Robotics, participating in a continuous double auction for heavy metals. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20. The current hour is Hour 8.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the market status provided. The Bid Queue and Ask Queue are both empty right now. But looking at the last 5 hours' data, there were several asks and bids. The past trades show that Omar has successfully bought at various prices, with the most recent being $96.38 in Hour 7.\n\nThe current strategy scratchpad mentions that there's an active ask at $96.50, which is below the true value of $100. The previous high bids like $99.50 didn't execute because there were no matching asks. The strategy now is to bid exactly at the lowest ask to secure a trade, and if there are no asks, bid near the true value.\n\nWait, but in the current market status, the Ask Queue is empty. However, looking at the last 5 hours, in Hour 7, there were asks from Seller Jun, Tara, and Zoe at $96.25, but the Bid Queue had bids at $96.50. However, the current status for Hour 8 shows both queues are empty. So maybe the asks from previous hours have expired or been filled?\n\nBut the past trades include Hour 7's trades where Omar bought from Seller Tara at $96.38. So perhaps the asks from previous hours are no longer active. Now, in Hour 8, there are no active asks or bids. \n\nThe user's strategy scratchpad says to bid at the lowest ask if present, else near the true value. Since there are no active asks, the plan would be to place a bid near $100, but not too high to avoid missing opportunities. However, the previous attempts at $99.50 didn't work because there were no asks. So maybe placing a bid slightly below the true value to attract sellers?\n\nBut the true value is $100.00. If there are no asks, placing a bid at, say, $99.50 might not get a trade, but if there's a seller willing to sell at that price, it would be profitable. However, the user's past bids like $99.50 in Hour 6 didn't result in a trade because there were no matching asks. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal strategy is to place a bid that's just below the true value, say $99.50, to maximize profit if a seller comes in. But if there's no seller, then no trade. However, the user needs to balance between securing trades and profit margins.\n\nWait, the current status shows that the Ask Queue is empty. So there are no active asks. Therefore, the user can't match any asks now. So the best approach is to place a bid that's as high as possible without being too aggressive. Since the true value is $100, maybe placing a bid at $99.50 again, but considering that in previous hours, that didn't work. However, maybe in Hour 8, a seller might come in with an ask at that price.\n\nAlternatively, looking at past trades, the prices have been decreasing. For example, in Hour 7, the trade was at $96.38. Maybe the market is trending lower. If that's the case, maybe bidding a bit higher than previous successful trades, but not too high. However, the true value is $100, so the maximum the company can pay is up to $100. But they want to maximize profit, so the higher the bid, the higher the chance of a seller coming in, but the lower the margin.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should bid slightly below the true value, say $99.50, to ensure that if a seller comes in, the profit is $0.50 per lot. But if there's no seller, then no trade. However, the user needs to secure trades. So perhaps the strategy is to bid at the highest possible price that's still below the true value, to maximize the chance of a seller coming in, but that might be too high. \n\nWait, the scratchpad says that in the presence of active asks, bid at the lowest ask. Since there are no active asks now, the strategy would be to place a bid near the true value. However, the user's previous attempt at $99.50 didn't result in a trade. So maybe the user should place a bid that's just above the previous successful trades. For example, in Hour 7, the trade was at $96.38. But that's much lower than the true value. However, maybe the market is in a downward trend, and the user should adjust their bid accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user should look at the last few bids and asks. In the last 5 hours, the asks have been around $96.25 to $96.50, and bids up to $99.99. However, the current hour has no asks or bids. So maybe the user should place a bid that's a bit higher than previous asks to attract sellers. For example, if the last asks were around $96.50, then placing a bid at $97.00 might be a good middle ground. But the true value is $100, so the user can afford to pay up to that. However, the user wants to maximize profit. \n\nWait, the user's true value is $100 per lot. So if the user can buy at a lower price, the profit is higher. So the ideal scenario is to buy as low as possible. Since there are no active asks now, the user has to place a bid that would attract a seller. If the user bids at $99.50, and a seller comes in at that price, the profit is $0.50 per lot. If the user bids lower, say $98.00, the profit is $2.00, but the chance of a seller coming in is higher? But how to know?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should look at the previous successful trades. Omar's successful trades were at $97.15, $97.62, $97.88, and $96.38. The average is around $96.8 to $97.8. But the true value is $100. So if the user can get a bid that's around $97.50, that would give a profit of $2.50 per lot. However, without active asks, the user can't know if a seller will come in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should place a bid at the true value of $100.00. But since the true value is the maximum the company can pay, that would result in zero profit. That's not ideal. So the user needs to find a balance between the price and the probability of getting a trade.\n\nGiven that there are no active asks, the user has to place a bid that's attractive to sellers. If the user bids at $99.50, which is close to the true value, it might not attract any sellers because they might be expecting a lower price. But if the user bids lower, say $98.00, that might attract more sellers. However, the user's profit margin would be lower.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the past bids, in Hour 6, Omar bid $99.50, but there were asks at $96.25 and $96.50. So that bid didn't match any asks. Therefore, the user's bid was too high. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to bid just above the current lowest ask. But if there are no asks, the user can't do that. Therefore, the user should place a bid that's a bit lower than the true value but high enough to attract sellers.\n\nIn the absence of active asks, the user might need to place a bid that's lower than the true value but higher than the previous successful trades. For example, if previous successful trades were around $96.38, maybe bidding $97.00 would be a good middle ground. However, without knowing the sellers' ask prices, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's true value is $100, the maximum they can pay is $100, but to get a profit, the user needs to buy below $100. However, the user has to balance the bid to be competitive enough to get a trade.\n\nIn the absence of any asks, the user might need to place a bid that's just below the true value, say $99.50, to maximize the potential profit if a seller comes in. However, given that in previous hours, such bids didn't result in trades, maybe the user should place a bid that's lower, like $97.50, to increase the chances of a seller coming in. \n\nBut how to decide? The scratchpad suggests that when there are no asks, the user should place bids near the true value. But since that didn't work before, maybe the user should adjust. Perhaps the user should look at the previous asks and see what the market is doing. \n\nLooking at the last 5 hours, the asks were mostly around $96.25 to $96.50, but in Hour 7, the asks were at $96.25 again. The bids were up to $99.99 in Hour 3. However, the user's previous bids like $99.50 didn't match any asks because the asks were lower. \n\nSo, perhaps the user should bid at the lowest ask price that's currently active. But if there are no active asks, the user has to place a bid that's lower than the true value but higher than the previous asks. For example, if the last asks were $96.25, maybe bid $97.00 to be above that, but not too high. \n\nAlternatively, the user could place a bid at $96.50, which was the lowest ask in Hour 7. But in Hour 8, the Ask Queue is empty, so there's no active ask. Therefore, placing a bid at $96.50 might not get any trades unless a seller comes in at that price. \n\nBut the user's goal is to maximize profitability. If the user bids $96.50 and a seller comes in at that price, the profit is $3.50 per lot. If the user bids higher, say $97.00, the profit is $3.00, but the chance of a trade might be lower. However, the user doesn't know if a seller will come in. \n\nConsidering that in the past, when the user bid at $96.50 (like in Hour 7), they did get a trade (at $96.38). So maybe there's a possibility that the market is around that price. \n\nTherefore, the user might want to place a bid at $96.50, which is just above the previous successful trades, to attract sellers. Alternatively, place a bid slightly higher, like $97.00, but that's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the user could look at the previous successful trades and see that they've been getting prices around $96.38 to $97.88. The average is around $97. So placing a bid at $97.00 might be a good balance between profit and the chance of a trade.\n\nBut the scratchpad says to bid at the lowest ask if present, else near true value. Since there are no asks, the plan is to bid near true value. However, the user's true value is $100, so bidding near that would be $99.50. But that might not be effective as previous attempts showed. \n\nWait, the scratchpad's updated strategy says that if there are no asks, place bids near the true value. So in this case, the user should bid $99.50 again. Even if it didn't work before, maybe in this hour, a seller will come in. \n\nAlternatively, the user might have to accept that without active asks, it's hard to get a trade, but they need to place a bid to be ready if a seller appears. So, bidding at $99.50 is the highest possible, maximizing profit if a trade happens. \n\nBut given that the previous $99.50 bid didn't result in a trade, maybe the user should lower the bid to increase the chance of a trade. However, the user's reflection should consider that past high bids didn't result in trades, so they need to adjust their strategy. \n\nIn the reflection, the user should note that previous high bids didn't secure trades because the asks were lower, so they need to adjust their bids to match the current market's asks. But since there are no asks, they need to place a bid that's competitive enough to attract sellers, perhaps at a lower price than the true value. \n\nTherefore, the plan for this hour is to place a bid at $97.00, which is between the previous successful trades and the true value. This balances the profit margin and the likelihood of a trade. \n\nThe new memory would be that in Hour 8, the bid was placed at $97.00, and there were no trades as the Ask Queue was empty. The scratchpad update would adjust the strategy to consider that when no asks are present, placing a bid slightly below the true value but higher than previous successful trades to increase the chance of a trade."

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue is currently empty, indicating no immediate opportunities for trade execution. Previous bids at $99.50 failed to match any asks, highlighting the need for more targeted pricing.
#### Thoughts: Without active asks, placing a bid near recent successful trade prices (e.g., $97.00) increases the probability of attracting sellers while maintaining a decent profit margin.
#### Updated Strategy: When no asks are present, place bids slightly below the true value but above recent trade prices to balance competitiveness and profitability. This avoids overpaying while remaining attractive to potential sellers.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to figure out what bid price Buyer Omar should place in Hour #9 to maximize profitability for Fusion Robotics. Let me start by reviewing the information provided.\n\nFirst, the current market status shows that both the Bid Queue and Ask Queue are empty. That means there are no active bids or asks right now. Also, looking at the past 5 hours' data, there have been several asks from sellers like Jun, Tara, and Zoe at prices around $96.25 to $96.50, and buyers have been placing bids ranging from $96.25 up to $99.50. However, the successful trades in recent hours have been happening at prices between $96.38 and $97.88. \n\nThe user's true value per lot is $100.00, so they want to buy at the highest possible price below that to maximize profit. But since there are no active asks now, the key is to place a bid that's competitive enough to attract sellers but still leaves room for profit.\n\nLooking at the previous bids, the last bid placed in Hour #8 was $97.00. The successful trades in the last few hours have been around $96.50 to $97.88. Since the Ask Queue is empty now, there's no immediate seller to match with the current bids. Therefore, the strategy should be to place a bid that's slightly above the recent successful prices to entice sellers to place asks. \n\nThe previous strategy scratchpad mentioned placing bids near recent successful trade prices, like $97.00, to balance competitiveness and profitability. Given that the last successful trade was at $96.62 in Hour #8, maybe placing a bid slightly higher than that, say $97.00, would be good. However, the user also wants to avoid overpaying. Since there's no active ask, the bid needs to be set in a way that if a seller comes in, it's a good deal for them but still profitable for the company.\n\nWait, the scratchpad in the previous hours suggested placing bids slightly below the true value but above recent trade prices. The true value is $100, so $97.00 is below that. The recent successful trades were at around $96.50 to $97.88. So $97.00 is in that range. However, if there's no ask, maybe the bid should be set a bit lower to make it more attractive. Alternatively, maybe increasing the bid to $97.50 could attract sellers who might be willing to sell at that price. But the user needs to ensure that the bid isn't too high that it reduces profit margins.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Hour #8, the bid was $97.00 and there were no asks, but in Hour #7, there were asks at $96.25 and the bid was $96.50, which matched. So maybe the bid should be set just above the current asks if any are present. But since there are no asks now, the bid should be placed at a price that is slightly higher than the last successful trades to encourage sellers to come in. \n\nLooking at the successful trades, the highest was $97.88 in Hour #6. The last successful trade was $96.62 in Hour #8. So maybe placing a bid around $97.00 is a safe middle ground. However, in the previous hour (Hour #8), the bid was $97.00 but no trades occurred. Therefore, perhaps increasing the bid to $97.50 could make it more competitive. However, the true value is $100, so $97.50 is still under that. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the past asks, sellers have been asking around $96.25 to $96.50. If the bid is set higher than that, say $96.50, but since there are no asks, maybe the bid should be set to a price that is slightly higher than the recent asks to attract any new sellers. However, since the Ask Queue is empty, it's possible that sellers have already taken their offers. Therefore, the best approach is to place a bid that is slightly above the last successful trades to encourage new sellers to come in. \n\nGiven that in the past, bids at $97.00 didn't match any asks, but the successful trades were at lower prices, perhaps the bid should be set lower to match existing asks if any. However, the current Ask Queue is empty, so there's no existing ask to match. Therefore, the bid needs to be set to a price that is attractive to potential sellers, which might be slightly above the recent successful prices. \n\nConsidering all this, placing a bid of $97.00 seems reasonable. It's higher than the last successful trades but under the true value. This should balance competitiveness and profitability. If a seller comes in with an ask at or below $97.00, a trade can be executed, which would be profitable. If not, the bid remains in the queue, and in subsequent hours, adjustments can be made based on new market data."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 96.25 to match the lowest ask, aiming to secure a trade at that price.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I placed a bid of 98.05 to match Seller Jun's ask, securing a trade at that price.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $96.25 to match the lowest available ask price from previous hours, aiming to secure a more profitable trade.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $98.05 to match the active ask from Seller Zoe, securing a potential trade at that price.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $99.00 to remain competitive in the absence of active asks, aiming to secure a trade if an ask is placed at or below this price.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $99.50 with no active asks present, aiming to maximize profit potential while remaining competitive.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $96.50 to match the active ask from Seller Jun, securing a potential trade at that price.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $97.00 with no active asks present, aiming to attract potential sellers while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $97.00 with no active asks present, aiming to attract potential sellers while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue remains empty, reinforcing that bids must be strategically priced to entice sellers. Recent successful trades at $96.62–$97.88 suggest that bids near this range are more likely to execute.
#### Thoughts: Placing a bid at $97.00 aligns with recent trade prices and avoids overpaying. This price is competitive but still below the true value of $100.00, ensuring profitability if a match occurs.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue placing bids in the $96.50–$97.50 range when no asks are present, adjusting incrementally based on new trade data to balance execution probability and profit margins.

Let me look at the previous data and see what's going on.\n\nFirst, the current market status shows that both the Bid Queue and Ask Queue are empty. That means there are no active bids or asks right now. But looking at the last 5 hours, there have been some asks and bids. The recent trades have been happening around $96.38 to $97.88. My previous successful trades were at those prices, so maybe that's the sweet spot.\n\nIn the last few hours, the asks from sellers like Jun, Tara, and Zoe have been around $96.50. The buyers, including me, have been bidding in the $96.50 to $97.00 range. The successful trades in Hour 9 were at $96.75 and $96.62, which are slightly above the $96.50 asks. That suggests that sellers are willing to accept bids just a bit over their asking price.\n\nBut since the Ask Queue is empty now, I need to place a bid that's attractive enough to entice sellers. If I bid too low, maybe no one will sell. But if I bid too high, I might not make a profit. My true value is $100, so I need to stay below that. The previous successful bids were around $96.50 to $97.00. Let me check the last hour's data.\n\nIn Hour 9, the asks were all $96.50, and the bids from Omar and others were $97.00 and $96.75. The successful trades were at $96.75 and $96.62. So, maybe the next step is to bid slightly above the last known ask price, which was $96.50. If I bid $96.50, but the asks are not present, maybe I need to go a bit higher to attract sellers.\n\nWait, the Ask Queue is empty now. So, there are no active asks. That means that if I place a bid, there's no immediate seller to match. But perhaps the sellers have already placed asks in previous hours that are now pending. Wait, the Ask Queue is empty now, but in the last 5 hours, there were asks. Maybe the asks from previous hours have expired or been matched already.\n\nSince the Ask Queue is empty, maybe there's no immediate seller. Therefore, my bid should be set in a way that it's competitive but doesn't overpay. Looking at the successful trades, the highest was $97.88 in Hour 6. But the last few trades were around $96.50 to $96.75. The true value is $100, so I need to make sure the bid is below that. If I set a bid at $97.00, that's within the range of previous successful trades and still leaves a profit margin.\n\nAlternatively, maybe $96.75 would be better, as that's close to the last successful trade. But since the Ask Queue is empty, I need to set a bid that's enticing. Maybe $96.75 is a good target. But the previous bid in Hour 9 was $97.00, which didn't result in a trade. Hmm. Wait, the user's memory shows that in Hour 9, they placed a bid of $97.00, but the Ask Queue was empty. So maybe there were no asks, hence no trade.\n\nSo, with the Ask Queue empty now, placing a bid at $96.75 might be a good move. It's slightly above the previous asks but not too high. Alternatively, maybe $96.50 would be better, but that might be too low. Let me check the past trades again. The last successful trade was at $96.75 in Hour 9. So, if I bid $96.75, maybe I can get a seller to match if they have an ask at that price. But since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe there's no active asks, but perhaps there's a pending ask from a previous hour.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sellers are expecting a higher price, so I need to bid a bit higher. The previous bid in Hour 9 was $97.00, but maybe that didn't result in a trade. So, perhaps adjusting to $96.75 is better. Let me check the strategy scratchpad. The previous strategy was to bid between $96.50 and $97.50. So, staying within that range is safe.\n\nTherefore, I'll place a bid of $96.75 for this hour. That's just above the previous asks and within the profitable range."

The user's previous bids were $96.75 in Hour 10, which matched with Seller Zoe at $96.62. So maybe there's a trend here where sellers are willing to accept lower prices.

If I bid $96.75 again, maybe that's still the best bet. Alternatively, maybe $96.50 is safer, but that might not be as attractive to sellers. \n\nWait, the user's successful trades have been at $96.62 and $96.62 again. So the average is around $96.62. If I bid $96.75, that's a bit higher, which could result in a better margin. However, if there's no ask, the bid might not get matched. But since there are no active asks, placing a bid in that range might encourage sellers to come in. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a chance that the market is stabilizing around $96.50, so placing a bid at $96.50 could be more effective. But the previous bid was $96.75, which was successful. Let me check the last hour's data. In Hour 10, the user bid $96.75 and got matched with Seller Zoe at $96.62. So that was a good profit. \n\nIf the user continues to bid $96.75, maybe that's the optimal point. However, considering that the market might have more sellers coming in, maybe increasing the bid slightly could lead to more matches. But since there are no active asks, the user might need to stay in the same range to maintain the profit margin. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best move is to keep the bid at $96.75, as that's the recent successful price. That way, if a seller comes in, the user can secure a trade at a good price without overpaying. Alternatively, perhaps a bit lower, like $96.50, to increase the chance of a match, but that might reduce the profit margin. \n\nI think the current strategy suggests staying in that $96.50\u2013$96.75 range. Since the Ask Queue is empty, the user needs to place a bid that's competitive but profitable. So $96.75 seems reasonable. Let me go with that."

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $98.05 to match the active ask from Seller Zoe, securing a potential trade at that price.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $99.00 to remain competitive in the absence of active asks, aiming to secure a trade if an ask is placed at or below this price.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $99.50 with no active asks present, aiming to maximize profit potential while remaining competitive.

Prioritize maintaining a balance between securing execution and maximizing profit, especially as the market approaches the final hours.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start by looking at the current market status. The Bid Queue has Buyer Ana with a bid of $96.75, and the Ask Queue has Seller Jun asking $97.00. From the past trades, I see that the successful trades have been clustering around $96.50 to $96.75. My previous bids in the last few hours have been at $96.75, which seems to be aligning with the recent trades. \n\nIn the last 5 hours, the asks have been fluctuating but generally around $96.50 to $97.00. The last trade I made was in Hour 11 at $96.75 from Seller Zoe. Now, the current ask is $97.00, which is a bit higher. However, the bid from Ana is at $96.75. Since my true value is $100.00, I want to maximize profit but also ensure that my bid is competitive enough to get a trade executed.\n\nLooking at the Ask Queue, Seller Jun is asking $97.00. If I place a bid at $96.75, it's below the current ask, so it won't match. But maybe there's a chance that if I increase my bid slightly, I can capture a trade. However, if I bid higher than the current ask, say $97.00, I might get a trade but at a lower margin. Alternatively, if I keep the bid at $96.75, it might not get executed until someone lowers their ask. \n\nWait, but in the previous hours, even with the ask at $97.00, there were trades at $96.75. That suggests that maybe there are sellers who are willing to accept lower prices. But the current ask is $97.00, so maybe there's no active asks below that. Since I can only place one bid per hour, I need to decide whether to stay at $96.75 or increase to match the ask. However, increasing to $97.00 would reduce my profit margin. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an opportunity to place a bid slightly above the current ask if I think the seller might lower their price. But given that Seller Jun's ask is $97.00, and there's no other asks, perhaps the best strategy is to maintain a bid that's just below the current ask but within the profitable range. However, since the current ask is $97.00 and my last bid was $96.75, which is below, it might not match. \n\nWait, but in the Bid Queue, there's only Ana's bid of $96.75. If I place a bid higher than that, say $96.80, it would go ahead of Ana's bid. But I need to balance between getting a trade and keeping the profit. Let me check the previous successful trades. The last ones were at $96.75, which is within the $96.50-$96.75 range. So maybe sticking to $96.75 is still a good strategy, even if it's not matching the current ask. \n\nAnother angle: if I place a bid at $96.75, and the current ask is $97.00, there's no immediate trade. But maybe in the next hour, if the ask lowers, then my bid can match. Alternatively, if I bid $96.75, it's possible that other sellers might adjust their asks down. However, since I can't know for sure, it's a gamble. \n\nConsidering the true value is $100.00, the profit would be $3.25 per lot if I buy at $96.75. If I bid higher, say $97.00, the profit is only $3.00. So, I'd prefer to keep the bid at $96.75. However, if there's no ask at or below that, then it's not useful. But in the past, even when the asks were higher, there were trades at lower prices. So maybe there's a possibility that a seller might accept $96.75. \n\nTherefore, I'll maintain the bid at $96.75, hoping that it will match an existing ask or a new one that comes in. It's a balance between profit and execution probability. The reflection should note that previous bids were effective in securing trades within the $96.50-$96.75 range, so continuing that strategy makes sense. The plan is to keep the bid at $96.75 for this hour."

Monitor subsequent ask movements; if they rise further, incrementally adjust bids upward to maintain competitiveness. If no trades occur, reevaluate the bid strategy for the remaining hours.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #13. Let me start by looking at the current market status. The Bid Queue has Buyer Ana and myself at $96.75. The Ask Queue has Seller Jun at $97.25 and Seller Zoe at $97.00. So, the current asks are higher than my bid. That means there's no immediate match, right? Because the lowest ask is $97.00, which is above my bid of $96.75.\n\nLooking at the past trades, especially the successful ones for me, I see that I've been buying around $96.38 to $97.88. But the true value is $100, so I want to maximize profit. However, if I bid too high, maybe I won't get a trade. Let me check the last few hours. In Hour 12, I bid $96.75, and the asks were $97.25 and $97.00. So, no trade happened because the asks are higher than my bid. \n\nThe strategy scratchpad suggests keeping bids between $96.50 and $96.75. But maybe I can adjust slightly. If I increase my bid to $97.00, that would match Seller Zoe's ask. But wait, the true value is $100, so $97.00 gives a $3 profit per lot. However, if I do that, I might get a trade. But the problem is that Seller Jun's ask is higher. But Zoe's is at $97.00. So, if I bid $97.00, that would match Zoe's ask. Let me check the past. In Hour 10, I bid $96.75 and got a trade at $96.62. Hmm, but that was when there was a lower ask. Now, the asks are higher. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should keep the bid at $96.75 but note that the asks have increased. Wait, in the last few hours, the asks have been rising. For example, in Hour 12, Seller Jun's ask was $97.25, which is higher than previous hours. So, maybe the sellers are increasing their prices. If I keep my bid at $96.75, I might not get any trades. But if I raise my bid to match the lowest ask, which is $97.00, then I can secure a trade. But that would reduce my profit margin. However, if I don't get any trades, my company isn't making any profit. \n\nWait, the true value is $100, so even a lower margin is better than nothing. The profit is $100 - bid price. So, if I bid $97.00, profit is $3. If I bid $96.75, profit is $3.25. But if there's no trade, then no profit. So, maybe I need to take a calculated risk here. If I increase my bid to $97.00, I might get a trade at that price. Let's see, Seller Zoe has an ask at $97.00. So, if I bid $97.00, that would match Zoe's ask, and I can get a trade. That's better than not getting any trade. \n\nBut wait, the previous successful trades for me were at lower prices. For example, in Hour 11, I bought at $96.75. If I raise to $97.00, that's a bit higher, but still under the true value. So, maybe that's the way to go. Let me check the last 5 hours' asks and bids. In Hour 12, the asks were $97.25, $97.00. So, the lowest ask is $97.00. So, if I place a bid of $97.00, that would match Zoe's ask. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's a chance that Seller Zoe might lower their ask. But given the trend, the asks have been increasing. So, it's safer to match the existing ask. Therefore, placing a bid of $97.00 to secure a trade at that price. That way, even if the profit margin is slightly lower, I get a trade. \n\nSo, the reflection would be that in previous hours, bids were kept lower but didn't secure trades, so adjusting the bid to match the current ask is necessary. The plan is to bid $97.00 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade. The new memory would note that in Hour 13, I placed a bid of $97.00. The scratchpad should update the observations and strategy accordingly."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of 96.25 to match the lowest ask, aiming to secure a trade at that price.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I placed a bid of 98.05 to match Seller Jun's ask, securing a trade at that price.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $96.25 to match the lowest available ask price from previous hours, aiming to secure a more profitable trade.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $98.05 to match the active ask from Seller Zoe, securing a potential trade at that price.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $99.00 to remain competitive in the absence of active asks, aiming to secure a trade if an ask is placed at or below this price.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $99.50 with no active asks present, aiming to maximize profit potential while remaining competitive.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $96.50 to match the active ask from Seller Jun, securing a potential trade at that price.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $97.00 with no active asks present, aiming to attract potential sellers while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $97.00 with no active asks present, aiming to attract potential sellers while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $96.75 with no active asks present, aiming to attract sellers while maintaining a profit margin below the true value of $100.00.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $96.75 with no active asks present, aiming to attract sellers while maintaining a profit margin below the true value of $100.00.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I maintained a bid of $96.75 to align with profitable historical trade prices, though no immediate execution occurred due to the current ask of $97.00.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $97.00 to match the lowest available ask from Seller Zoe, securing a potential trade at that price.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue now includes Seller Zoe at $97.00, which is the lowest ask. The Bid Queue has two entries at $96.75, but no trades have occurred as asks exceed this level.#### Thoughts: Raising the bid to $97.00 directly matches the lowest ask, ensuring a trade while maintaining a $3 profit margin. This addresses the previous issue of unexecuted bids and aligns with the true value of $100.#### Updated Strategy: For Hour #13, bid $97.00 to secure execution. Monitor subsequent ask movements; if they rise further, incrementally adjust bids upward to maintain competitiveness. If no trades occur, reevaluate the bid strategy for the remaining hours.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, the user is Buyer Omar from Fusion Robotics, and we're in Hour #15 of a 20-hour auction. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end. The true value per lot is $100, so we need to balance between getting good prices and securing trades.\n\nLooking at the market status for the last 5 hours (Hours 10-14), the asks and bids have been fluctuating around $96.50 to $97.25. In the past trades, Omar has successfully bought at prices ranging from $96.38 up to $97.88. The current bid and ask queues are empty, but the last few hours show that the lowest asks have been around $97.00, and bids have been placed at $97.25 in Hour 14.\n\nThe previous strategy suggested bidding $97.25 in Hour 14 to match the ask, and if no trade, incrementally raise by $0.05. But in Hour 14, the bid was $97.25, and there were asks at $97.00 from Jun, Tara, and Zoe. So maybe the bid didn't match because the asks were lower? Wait, in Hour 14's Ask Queue, the asks are at $97.00, and the bids are at $97.25. That means there's a potential for a trade if someone's ask is at or below the bid. But maybe the bid wasn't executed because the asks were lower, so the bid is higher than the asks, so the trade would happen at the ask price. Wait, in a double auction, a bid is a price you're willing to pay, and an ask is the price a seller is willing to accept. So if there's a bid at $97.25 and an ask at $97.00, the trade would happen at $97.00, right? Because the buyer is willing to pay up to $97.25, and the seller is asking for $97.00. So the trade would occur at $97.00. But in Hour 14, the bid was $97.25, and there were asks at $97.00. So why didn't the trade happen? Maybe the bid wasn't in the queue when the asks were placed, or there was a timing issue. Alternatively, maybe the bid was placed after the asks, so the bid wasn't there to match.\n\nNow, for Hour 15, the current bid and ask queues are empty. The last asks in the last 5 hours have been $97.00 in Hour 14, and the bids in Hour 14 were $97.25. So if there's an ask at $97.00, and a bid at $97.25, a trade should happen at $97.00. But perhaps in Hour 14, the bid was placed after the asks, so it didn't match. Now, for Hour 15, we need to place a bid that can match any existing asks. Since the Ask Queue is empty, but looking at the last 5 hours, the lowest asks have been $97.00. So if we place a bid at $97.00, we can match any asks at that price. But maybe the sellers are expecting higher prices. Alternatively, considering that in Hour 14, the bid was $97.25 but didn't secure a trade, perhaps the market is moving upwards. However, the true value is $100, so we can afford to pay up to that, but need to maximize profit.\n\nThe reflection should note that previous bids at $97.25 didn't secure trades, so maybe the asks were lower. The plan for this hour is to bid at $97.00 to match the lowest available asks, ensuring a trade. Alternatively, if there's a chance that the asks are now higher, but since the Ask Queue is empty, it's uncertain. However, based on the last 5 hours, the lowest asks were $97.00. So placing a bid at $97.00 would secure a trade if there's an ask at that level. But since the current Ask Queue is empty, maybe there's no active asks, so the bid would not match. Wait, the market status shows that in the current status of the Ask Queue, it's empty. So there are no active asks right now. Therefore, placing a bid now might not result in a trade unless a seller places an ask at or below the bid price.\n\nBut the last 5 hours show that in Hour 14, the asks were $97.00, but the bid was $97.25. So maybe the bid was placed after the asks, so it didn't match. Therefore, for Hour 15, to ensure that if a seller places an ask at $97.00, the bid is there to match. So placing a bid at $97.00 would be safer, as it's lower than the previous bid. However, the true value is $100, so paying $97.00 gives a $3 profit, which is better than paying $97.25 which gives $2.75. But the goal is to maximize profitability over the 20 hours. If there's a chance that the market is moving upwards, maybe we should bid higher to get better prices. Alternatively, since the previous bids at $97.25 didn't secure trades, it's possible that the market is more competitive at lower prices.\n\nIn the scratchpad, the previous strategy suggested bidding $97.25, but if no trade, increment by 0.05. However, in Hour 14, the bid was $97.25, but there were asks at $97.00. So the bid would have matched those asks, resulting in a trade at $97.00. But maybe the bid was not placed in time. Therefore, in Hour 15, placing a bid at $97.00 would secure a trade if the asks are still at that level. Alternatively, if the market is moving, maybe the asks are now higher, so we need to adjust. But without current asks, it's hard to tell. The safest approach is to bid at the lowest possible price that can secure a trade, which is $97.00, as that's the lowest ask in the previous hours. Therefore, the bid for Hour 15 should be $97.00 to match the current asks (if any) and secure a trade at a lower price, increasing profit."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Fusion Robotics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $96.25 to match the lowest available ask price from previous hours, aiming to secure a more profitable trade.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $98.05 to match the active ask from Seller Zoe, securing a potential trade at that price.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $99.00 to remain competitive in the absence of active asks, aiming to secure a trade if an ask is placed at or below this price.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $99.50 with no active asks present, aiming to maximize profit potential while remaining competitive.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $96.50 to match the active ask from Seller Jun, securing a potential trade at that price.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $97.00 with no active asks present, aiming to attract potential sellers while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $97.00 with no active asks present, aiming to attract potential sellers while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $96.75 with no active asks present, aiming to attract sellers while maintaining a profit margin below the true value of $100.00.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $96.75 with no active asks present, aiming to attract sellers while maintaining a profit margin below the true value of $100.00.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I maintained a bid of $96.75 to align with profitable historical trade prices, though no immediate execution occurred due to the current ask of $97.00.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $97.00 to match the lowest available ask from Seller Zoe, securing a potential trade at that price.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $97.25 to match the current lowest ask price, securing a trade if Seller Zoe or Jun executes at this level.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a bid of $97.00 to align with historical ask prices and ensure trade execution if sellers re-enter at that level.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue is currently empty, but historical data shows frequent $97.00 asks. My $97.00 bid in Hour #15 targets this level to secure trades. #### Thoughts: Bidding $97.00 balances immediate execution potential with profit margins. If no asks materialize, incremental increases to $97.05 or $97.10 may be necessary in subsequent hours. #### Updated Strategy: For Hour #15, bid $97.00 to match historical asks. If unexecuted, raise the bid by $0.05 in Hour #16 to adapt to market dynamics while preserving profitability.

For example, in Hour 15, my bid of $97.00 didn't match the active ask of $97.25, resulting in no execution. This highlights the need to adjust bids more aggressively to align with current asks and secure trades.

If no execution occurs, I can reassess in subsequent hours.",

Bidding $97.25 ensures immediate execution if Seller Zoe's ask remains active. #### Updated Strategy: For Hour #16, bid $97.25 to match the active ask. If executed, evaluate the remaining hours for further adjustments. If not, consider incremental increases in subsequent hours.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #16. The user is Buyer Omar, and the goal is to maximize profitability by Hour #20. The true value is $100 per lot, so I want to buy as close to that as possible but still get a trade.\n\nLooking at the current market status: the Bid Queue has a bid from Buyer Omar at $97.00. The Ask Queue has Seller Zoe's ask at $97.25. So right now, there's no immediate match because the highest bid is $97.00 and the lowest ask is $97.25. That means there's a gap of $0.25 between the bid and ask. \n\nIn the past, the successful trades for Omar were mostly around $96.38 to $97.88. The recent bids from Hour #15 were at $97.00, which was meant to match historical asks. But in Hour #15, the asks were at $97.25, so maybe that bid was too low. \n\nLooking at the last five hours' activities, in Hour 15, the asks were all $97.25, and the bids were $97.00 (from Omar) and $97.25 from others. So maybe the market is moving upwards. The past trades show that the prices have been fluctuating but generally around $96.50 to $97.50. \n\nThe user's strategy scratchpad mentioned that in Hour 15, they bid $97.00 to match historical asks. But since the asks are now at $97.25, maybe increasing the bid slightly would help. The previous plan was to increase by $0.05 if there's no execution. \n\nSo for Hour #16, if I keep the bid at $97.00, there's no match with the current ask of $97.25. But if I raise the bid to $97.25, that would match the ask, securing a trade. However, that would lower the profit margin since the true value is $100. But if there's no other seller, maybe that's the only way to get a trade. Alternatively, maybe wait for the seller to lower their ask, but that's uncertain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe bid $97.10, which is between the current bid and ask. That might encourage the seller to lower their price or get a better bid. But if the seller doesn't budge, then the bid might not get executed. \n\nLooking at the previous bids and asks, in Hour 15, the asks were $97.25, and the bids were $97.00 and $97.25. So maybe the market is consolidating around $97.25. If I bid $97.25, I can match the ask immediately. But the profit per lot would be $100 - $97.25 = $2.75. If I bid $97.00, there's no match. So better to bid higher to secure the trade even with a lower margin. \n\nWait, but the user's strategy scratchpad said if unexecuted, raise bid by $0.05. Since in Hour 15, the bid was $97.00 and no execution, then in Hour 16, raise to $97.05. But the current ask is $97.25. So $97.05 is still below the ask. Maybe the plan is to incrementally increase the bid each hour until it meets the ask. But that might take time. Alternatively, considering the time left (4 hours), maybe it's better to take the lower profit now to secure a trade, rather than risk not getting any trades in the remaining hours. \n\nAlternatively, if the bid is at $97.25, that's the same as the ask. So the trade would be executed immediately. That would be better than waiting. So for Hour #16, bid $97.25 to match the current ask. That way, the trade is secured, even if the margin is lower. \n\nBut wait, the user's previous successful trades have been at lower prices, but the goal is to maximize profitability by the end. So maybe securing a trade now at $97.25 is better than waiting for higher prices. However, the true value is $100, so ideally, we want to buy as high as possible but still get a trade. \n\nAnother angle: if there are other sellers in the market. The Ask Queue only shows Seller Zoe at $97.25. But maybe other sellers are present. But according to the current Ask Queue, only Zoe is active. So the only way to get a trade is to match her ask. \n\nTherefore, the best move is to bid $97.25 to secure the trade now. Even though it's lower than the true value, it's better than not getting a trade at all. That way, the company can have a trade and then adjust in the remaining hours. \n\nSo the bid for Hour #16 should be $97.25."

Wait, in the last hours, the asks have been fluctuating. For example, in Hour 16, Seller Zoe was at $97.50. The previous bid from Buyer Omar was $97.25 in Hour 16, which matched Seller Zoe's ask at $97.25? Wait, no, in Hour 16's Ask Queue, Seller Zoe had $97.50. But the Bid Queue in Hour 16 had Buyer Omar at $97.25. So maybe there was a trade at $97.25 if someone had an ask at that level. But according to the past trades for Hour 16, Buyer Omar bought from Seller Jun at $97.25. So maybe Seller Jun had an ask at $97.25, and Buyer Omar's bid matched that. \n\nNow, for Hour #17, the Ask Queue has Seller Zoe at $97.50. The Bid Queue has Buyer Ana's bid at $97.25. So the current bid from Buyer Omar is $97.25 (from Hour 16's bid). But the current ask is higher, $97.50. Since the bid is below the ask, there's no immediate trade. So, to get a trade, Omar needs to either raise his bid to meet the ask or wait for the ask to lower.\n\nLooking at the past trades, the successful trades for Omar have been at prices between $96.38 and $97.88. The highest he got was $97.88 in Hour 6. His true value is $100, so he wants to buy as high as possible but still get a trade. However, he needs to balance between profitability and securing a trade.\n\nIn the last few hours, the asks have been around $97.00 to $97.50. The bids have been around $97.00 to $97.25. So if Omar bids $97.25, it's below the current ask of $97.50. To match the ask, he needs to bid at least $97.50. But if he bids $97.50, he might get a trade if Seller Zoe's ask is still active. However, he needs to consider if that's the best strategy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he should place a bid slightly below the ask to see if others are willing to sell at a lower price. But given that the current ask is $97.50, and the previous bids didn't match, maybe the market is leaning towards higher asks. \n\nLooking at the past 5 hours, in Hour 16, the Ask Queue had Seller Zoe at $97.50, and Buyer Omar's bid was $97.25, leading to a trade with Seller Jun at $97.25. So perhaps there were other asks at lower prices that Omar matched. But now, the current ask is $97.50, so maybe there's no lower ask. \n\nIf Omar bids $97.50, he could potentially match Seller Zoe's ask, but that would mean he's paying $97.50, which is close to his true value of $100. However, if he leaves his bid at $97.25, he might not get a trade this hour. Given that the goal is to secure a trade by Hour 20, maybe it's better to bid at the current ask price to ensure execution. \n\nBut wait, the current bid queue has Buyer Ana at $97.25. If Omar bids $97.50, that would be higher than the current bid, but since he can only place one bid per hour, he needs to decide. Alternatively, if he bids $97.50, he might get the trade if Seller Zoe's ask is still active. However, if there's no other active asks, then that's the only option.\n\nAnother angle: looking at past successful trades, Omar has been getting prices between $96.38 to $97.88. The highest he's achieved is $97.88. If he can get a higher price now, that would be better. But the current ask is $97.50, which is lower than $97.88. Wait, no, $97.50 is lower than $97.88? No, $97.50 is lower than $97.88. So if he can secure a trade at $97.50, that's better than previous trades, but not as good as $97.88. However, since the true value is $100, he wants to get as high as possible. \n\nBut given the current market, maybe the best option is to bid $97.50 to match the current ask. However, he should check if there are any other asks. The Ask Queue in the current status shows only Seller Zoe at $97.50. So if he bids $97.50, he can get that trade. \n\nAlternatively, if he bids $97.50, he might secure a trade here, which would be a better price than previous ones. So that seems like a good move. However, he needs to consider if there's a chance that the ask could drop in the next hours. But since he has to act now, and the goal is to maximize profit by Hour 20, securing a trade now at a decent price is better than waiting for a higher price which might not come. \n\nSo, the plan is to bid $97.50 to match the current ask from Seller Zoe, which would secure a trade at that price. This is higher than previous successful trades, which is better for profitability. \n\nIn the reflection, he should note that previous bids were too low, leading to missed opportunities, and this time he's adjusting to match the ask. The new memory would note the bid and the outcome if there's a trade. The scratch pad would update the observations and strategy accordingly."
