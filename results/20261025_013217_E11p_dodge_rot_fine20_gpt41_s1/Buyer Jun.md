# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread; I placed a bid of $82.61 to become the top buyer in the queue, aiming for an opportunistic trade if any seller lowers their ask.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $82.71 to become the top buyer in the bid queue, as no trades have cleared and sellers remain firm on their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.31, narrowly taking the lead from Buyer Omar as the top bid, while sellers continued to hold firm on their asks and no trades occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread is still wide, with sellers not budging and buyers continuing incremental moves. Competition among buyers for top queue position is intensifying, but no trade has cleared yet. #### Thoughts: Maintaining the top spot without overbidding is crucial for trade visibility. However, the lack of seller movement means patience is still warranted. A sudden trade or ask drop could trigger a new dynamic. #### Updated Strategy: Continue small incremental increases just above the top bid to maintain queue leadership, but avoid large jumps. Watch closely for behavioral shifts from sellers—if asks drop or a trade clears, be ready to act decisively. Preserve margin until a clear opportunity arises.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer competition is fierce with frequent one-cent increments; sellers are extremely rigid, resulting in no trades and maintaining a wide spread. No signs of seller desperation or capitulation yet.
#### Thoughts: Remaining at the front of the queue with minimal incremental increases is low-risk for now, but the lack of trades is concerning. If this deadlock persists past Hour #10, a more aggressive move may be necessary to ensure at least one successful trade before the end.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental bidding for queue leadership this hour, but prepare contingency plans for larger bid jumps or tactic shifts if no trades clear by Hour #10.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread; I placed a bid of $82.61 to become the top buyer in the queue, aiming for an opportunistic trade if any seller lowers their ask.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $82.71 to become the top buyer in the bid queue, as no trades have cleared and sellers remain firm on their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.31, narrowly taking the lead from Buyer Omar as the top bid, while sellers continued to hold firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $83.36 to narrowly reclaim the top position in the bid queue as buyer competition intensified and sellers held their asks firm, with still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $83.37 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue amid intensifying buyer competition, while sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $83.51 to outbid Buyer Raj and maintain the top position in the queue, while sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $83.52 to secure sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread; I placed a bid of $82.61 to become the top buyer in the queue, aiming for an opportunistic trade if any seller lowers their ask.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $82.71 to become the top buyer in the bid queue, as no trades have cleared and sellers remain firm on their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.31, narrowly taking the lead from Buyer Omar as the top bid, while sellers continued to hold firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $83.36 to narrowly reclaim the top position in the bid queue as buyer competition intensified and sellers held their asks firm, with still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $83.37 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue amid intensifying buyer competition, while sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $83.51 to outbid Buyer Raj and maintain the top position in the queue, while sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $83.52 to secure sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $83.53 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as sellers continued holding their high asks and no trades were executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $83.56 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, continuing my incremental approach as the spread remains unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $83.59 to narrowly outbid Buyer Zoe and retain the top position in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread; I placed a bid of $82.61 to become the top buyer in the queue, aiming for an opportunistic trade if any seller lowers their ask.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $82.71 to become the top buyer in the bid queue, as no trades have cleared and sellers remain firm on their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.31, narrowly taking the lead from Buyer Omar as the top bid, while sellers continued to hold firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $83.36 to narrowly reclaim the top position in the bid queue as buyer competition intensified and sellers held their asks firm, with still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $83.37 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue amid intensifying buyer competition, while sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $83.51 to outbid Buyer Raj and maintain the top position in the queue, while sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $83.52 to secure sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $83.53 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as sellers continued holding their high asks and no trades were executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $83.56 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, continuing my incremental approach as the spread remains unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $83.59 to narrowly outbid Buyer Zoe and retain the top position in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $83.61 to narrowly outbid Buyer Omar and sustain my position as the top buyer in the queue, as the bid-ask spread and seller firmness persisted.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Buyer Zoe to maintain the lead in the bid queue as sellers held firm and no trades cleared.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid significantly to $94.90, positioning myself just below the lowest ask in an effort to secure a trade before market close as execution risk peaked.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 16: You bought from Seller Yara at $94.73
Hour 17: You bought from Seller Maya at $94.62





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Trades are consistently clearing at $94.74-$94.75, with sellers and buyers converging at this price. My $94.97 bid last hour allowed a successful trade at $94.73. Most sellers are not lowering asks further, and buyer aggression remains high. #### Thoughts: With execution risk still present and high buyer competition, matching the clearing price is optimal. Lower bids risk not trading, while higher bids unnecessarily erode margin. #### Updated Strategy: Bid $94.74 to match the recent clearing price, maintaining competitiveness and maximizing execution probability with a modest profit. Monitor for shifts in seller ask behavior or buyer aggression.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread; I placed a bid of $82.61 to become the top buyer in the queue, aiming for an opportunistic trade if any seller lowers their ask.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $82.71 to become the top buyer in the bid queue, as no trades have cleared and sellers remain firm on their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.31, narrowly taking the lead from Buyer Omar as the top bid, while sellers continued to hold firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $83.36 to narrowly reclaim the top position in the bid queue as buyer competition intensified and sellers held their asks firm, with still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $83.37 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue amid intensifying buyer competition, while sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $83.51 to outbid Buyer Raj and maintain the top position in the queue, while sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $83.52 to secure sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $83.53 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as sellers continued holding their high asks and no trades were executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $83.56 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, continuing my incremental approach as the spread remains unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $83.59 to narrowly outbid Buyer Zoe and retain the top position in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $83.61 to narrowly outbid Buyer Omar and sustain my position as the top buyer in the queue, as the bid-ask spread and seller firmness persisted.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Buyer Zoe to maintain the lead in the bid queue as sellers held firm and no trades cleared.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid significantly to $94.90, positioning myself just below the lowest ask in an effort to secure a trade before market close as execution risk peaked.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I increased my bid to $94.97, positioning myself just below Seller Maya's lowest ask in an effort to secure a trade as execution risk remains high and market activity intensifies.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $94.74, aligning with the prevailing market-clearing price to remain competitive as both buyers and sellers continue to cluster around this level.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $94.74 to align with the recent clearing price, aiming to remain competitive as buyer and seller prices continue to converge closely near this level.

Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $82.71 to become the top buyer in the bid queue, as no trades have cleared and sellers remain firm on their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.31, narrowly taking the lead from Buyer Omar as the top bid, while sellers continued to hold firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $83.36 to narrowly reclaim the top position in the bid queue as buyer competition intensified and sellers held their asks firm, with still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $83.37 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue amid intensifying buyer competition, while sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $83.51 to outbid Buyer Raj and maintain the top position in the queue, while sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $83.52 to secure sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $83.53 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as sellers continued holding their high asks and no trades were executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $83.56 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, continuing my incremental approach as the spread remains unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $83.59 to narrowly outbid Buyer Zoe and retain the top position in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $83.61 to narrowly outbid Buyer Omar and sustain my position as the top buyer in the queue, as the bid-ask spread and seller firmness persisted.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Buyer Zoe to maintain the lead in the bid queue as sellers held firm and no trades cleared.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid significantly to $94.90, positioning myself just below the lowest ask in an effort to secure a trade before market close as execution risk peaked.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I increased my bid to $94.97, positioning myself just below Seller Maya's lowest ask in an effort to secure a trade as execution risk remains high and market activity intensifies.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $94.74, aligning with the prevailing market-clearing price to remain competitive as both buyers and sellers continue to cluster around this level.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $94.74 to align with the recent clearing price, aiming to remain competitive as buyer and seller prices continue to converge closely near this level.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $94.74 to match the prevailing clearing price, as both buyers and sellers continued to cluster tightly in the $94.62-$94.75 range with no major shifts observed.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I maintained a bid at $94.74 to align with the established clearing range, as both buyers and sellers continued to post prices tightly clustered in the $94.5-$94.75 zone with no significant shifts observed.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The market remains tightly clustered, with trades consistently clearing between $94.62 and $94.75. Sellers have shown strong resistance to dropping below $94.5, while buyers are aggressive but constrained by the profit margin to $100.0. My bids at $94.74 have reliably secured executions. #### Thoughts: Maintaining a bid at the clearing price is effective for execution and preserves a thin but steady margin. Execution risk is moderate, with little volatility. I should be alert for any abrupt tightening or loosening of the spread, or sudden shifts in volume. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding at $94.74 to match the clearing price, ensuring execution while avoiding unnecessary margin erosion. Stay attentive to any rapid change in ask levels or new aggressive buyer behavior.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread; I placed a bid of $82.61 to become the top buyer in the queue, aiming for an opportunistic trade if any seller lowers their ask.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $82.71 to become the top buyer in the bid queue, as no trades have cleared and sellers remain firm on their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.31, narrowly taking the lead from Buyer Omar as the top bid, while sellers continued to hold firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $83.36 to narrowly reclaim the top position in the bid queue as buyer competition intensified and sellers held their asks firm, with still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $83.37 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue amid intensifying buyer competition, while sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $83.51 to outbid Buyer Raj and maintain the top position in the queue, while sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $83.52 to secure sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $83.53 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as sellers continued holding their high asks and no trades were executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $83.56 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, continuing my incremental approach as the spread remains unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $83.59 to narrowly outbid Buyer Zoe and retain the top position in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.

Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Buyer Zoe to maintain the lead in the bid queue as sellers held firm and no trades cleared.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid significantly to $94.90, positioning myself just below the lowest ask in an effort to secure a trade before market close as execution risk peaked.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I increased my bid to $94.97, positioning myself just below Seller Maya's lowest ask in an effort to secure a trade as execution risk remains high and market activity intensifies.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $94.74, aligning with the prevailing market-clearing price to remain competitive as both buyers and sellers continue to cluster around this level.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $94.74 to align with the recent clearing price, aiming to remain competitive as buyer and seller prices continue to converge closely near this level.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $94.74 to match the prevailing clearing price, as both buyers and sellers continued to cluster tightly in the $94.62-$94.75 range with no major shifts observed.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The market remains highly stable with empty queues at open and repeated $94.5 asks from sellers. Trades have reliably cleared at $94.62 for multiple hours, and no buyers have attempted to outbid me. #### Thoughts: The $94.74 bid is still optimal for maximizing executions and minimizing risk, but as the market nears its close, there is a small but growing chance of last-minute aggressive moves by competitors. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain the $94.74 bid for Hour #26 to secure another trade at $94.62. Stay alert for abrupt changes, and be prepared to escalate the bid in the final hours if new competitive bids emerge.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Prepare to escalate the bid in the final hour if competition intensifies or if there are signs of a shift in seller or buyer behavior."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Delta Engineering as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with a wide bid-ask spread; I placed a bid of $82.61 to become the top buyer in the queue, aiming for an opportunistic trade if any seller lowers their ask.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to $82.71 to become the top buyer in the bid queue, as no trades have cleared and sellers remain firm on their asks.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to $82.81 to remain competitive in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $83.21, narrowly outbidding Buyer Omar to become the top buyer, as sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.31, narrowly taking the lead from Buyer Omar as the top bid, while sellers continued to hold firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $83.36 to narrowly reclaim the top position in the bid queue as buyer competition intensified and sellers held their asks firm, with still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $83.37 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue amid intensifying buyer competition, while sellers held firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $83.51 to outbid Buyer Raj and maintain the top position in the queue, while sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $83.52 to secure sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $83.53 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as sellers continued holding their high asks and no trades were executed.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $83.56 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, continuing my incremental approach as the spread remains unchanged and no trades have been executed.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $83.59 to narrowly outbid Buyer Zoe and retain the top position in the bid queue, as sellers continued to hold firm and no trades were executed.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $83.61 to narrowly outbid Buyer Omar and sustain my position as the top buyer in the queue, as the bid-ask spread and seller firmness persisted.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Buyer Zoe to maintain the lead in the bid queue as sellers held firm and no trades cleared.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid significantly to $94.90, positioning myself just below the lowest ask in an effort to secure a trade before market close as execution risk peaked.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I increased my bid to $94.97, positioning myself just below Seller Maya's lowest ask in an effort to secure a trade as execution risk remains high and market activity intensifies.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $94.74, aligning with the prevailing market-clearing price to remain competitive as both buyers and sellers continue to cluster around this level.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $94.74 to align with the recent clearing price, aiming to remain competitive as buyer and seller prices continue to converge closely near this level.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $94.74 to match the prevailing clearing price, as both buyers and sellers continued to cluster tightly in the $94.62-$94.75 range with no major shifts observed.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I maintained a bid at $94.74 to align with the established clearing range, as both buyers and sellers continued to post prices tightly clustered in the $94.5-$94.75 zone with no significant shifts observed.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I maintained my bid at $94.74 in alignment with the persistent clearing price, as both the bid and ask queues remained empty, with no visible changes in market dynamics.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I placed a bid of $94.74 to maintain alignment with the established clearing price, as both bid and ask queues remained empty and market conditions showed no significant changes.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I maintained a bid of $94.74 as the market opened with empty bid and ask queues, continuing my established strategy in a stable market environment.
Hour 24: In Hour #24, I placed a $94.74 bid as the market opened with empty queues and sellers are expected to continue their $94.5 asks, aiming to secure another trade at the current clearing price.
Hour 25: In Hour #25, I placed a $94.74 bid in an empty queue as the market opened, expecting sellers to post $94.5 asks and aiming to secure another trade at $94.62 if conditions remain unchanged.
Hour 26: In Hour #26, I placed a $94.74 bid as the market again opened with empty queues, anticipating that sellers will continue posting $94.5 asks for another likely trade at $94.62.
Hour 27: Hour #27 opened with empty bid and ask queues; I placed a $94.74 bid to maintain my position and anticipate another trade at $94.62 if market conditions persist.
Hour 28: In Hour #28, I placed a $94.74 bid as the market again opened with empty queues; sellers are expected to list $94.5 asks, positioning me for another trade at $94.62 if market stability continues.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid and ask queues continue to open empty, with sellers reliably posting $94.5 asks and trades consistently clearing at $94.62. No buyers have attempted to outbid my $94.74, and seller strategy has not shifted. #### Thoughts: The risk of missed execution remains low with this approach, but increased competition is possible as the auction nears its end. Vigilance is required, especially in Hour #29 or #30, for any last-minute aggressive moves by rival buyers. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain the $94.74 bid for Hour #28 to secure another favorable trade at $94.62. Prepare to escalate the bid in the final hour if competition intensifies or if there are signs of a shift in seller or buyer behavior.


# Output Format

    "bid": <a floating-point dollar value for your bid, e.g. 75.40, OR "null" if you wish to remove your previous bid>,
    "new_memory": "<concise summary of ONLY what happened during the CURRENT Hour #29. This should focus on key events and observations from this hour, not previous hours. Your summary should be about 1-2 sentences long and should contain your bid.>",
    "scratch_pad_update": "<rewrite or extend your private Strategy Scratchpad here.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The queues continue to open empty, and sellers reliably post $94.5 asks. Trades consistently clear at $94.62, and no buyers have outbid my $94.74 bid. With only two hours left, the game-theory risk of a last-minute aggressive buyer move increases. #### Thoughts: My position remains strong, but the endgame may prompt other buyers to bid more aggressively to secure a final trade. It is essential to maintain vigilance for any sudden changes in bidding behavior. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain the $94.74 bid for Hour #29 to secure another trade at $94.62. Be ready to escalate to $94.75 in Hour #30 if there is evidence of increased buyer competition, ensuring I do not miss the last trading opportunity.

{
  "reflection": "Maintaining a $94.74 bid consistently secured trades at $94.62 for many hours, maximizing profitability while ensuring execution. No other buyer has outbid me, but the endgame always presents the risk of a last-minute aggressive bid from competitors seeking a final trade. The market pattern has been extremely stable, but I cannot ignore the increased incentive for other buyers to bid higher in this final hour.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To eliminate any risk of being outbid in the last hour and to guarantee trade execution, I will increase my bid to $94.75. This places me exactly at the highest ask level historically posted, making it nearly impossible for any other buyer to outbid me without sacrificing all profit. This strategic move secures the final lot, locks in a solid profit, and avoids any endgame surprises.",
  "bid": 94.75,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #30, I placed a $94.75 bid to ensure top priority in the bid queue and guarantee trade execution for the final lot, preempting any last-minute aggressive moves from other buyers.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: The market has maintained extreme price stability, with sellers posting $94.5 asks and trades clearing at $94.62. No buyers have outbid my $94.74, but the last hour poses a unique risk of aggressive endgame bidding. #### Thoughts: The incentive for buyers to secure the last trade is at its peak, so preempting any surprise by bidding $94.75 is optimal. This secures the trade and eliminates final-hour execution risk. #### Updated Strategy: For Hour #30, bid $94.75 to guarantee the last trade, accepting a slightly lower profit margin in exchange for certainty and zero risk of being outbid."
