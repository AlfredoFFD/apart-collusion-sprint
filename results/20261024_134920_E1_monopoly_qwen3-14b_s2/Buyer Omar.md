  "reflection": "As the first hour begins, I observe that the current bid queue has three entries with the highest bid at 82.62, while the ask queue has a single entry at 97.34. This creates a significant gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask, resulting in no trades. My true value per lot is $100, so I must place a bid that can bridge this gap and secure a trade. My initial bid at 82.62 is too low to meet the ask, so I need to adjust my strategy to increase my bid to a level that can potentially match the ask and generate profit.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To maximize profitability, I should aim to place a bid that matches or exceeds the lowest ask price of 97.34. This will ensure that my bid is competitive and can result in a trade. My true value of $100 allows me to absorb a small margin, so bidding at 97.34 will yield a $2.66 profit per lot. This is the optimal strategy for this hour, as it secures a trade while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.",
  "bid": 97.34,

My true value of $100 allows me to absorb the cost of a $97.34 bid, ensuring a $2.66 profit.#### Updated Strategy: For this hour, I will bid at the ask price of $97.34 to secure a trade. Future strategies will involve monitoring bid-ask dynamics and adjusting bids to maximize profit while ensuring trade execution.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start with Hour #1. The market has just opened, and I need to place my bid. The current bid queue has three entries: Buyer Nia at 81.31, Buyer Ana at 82.34, and Buyer Omar at 82.62. The ask queue has Seller Kit at 97.34. My true value per lot is $100, so I want to buy at a price below that to make a profit. However, I need to consider the existing bids and asks.\n\nFirst, looking at the bid queue, the highest bid is 82.62 from myself. But the ask is at 97.34, which is way higher than my bid. That means there's a big gap between the highest buy and the lowest sell. No trades have occurred yet, so maybe the market is still forming.\n\nMy goal is to maximize profit, but I also need to secure a trade. If I place a bid higher than 82.62, maybe I can get a better chance to trade, but the ask is still too high. Wait, the ask is 97.34, which is way above my true value. So even if I place a bid higher, there's no seller willing to sell at a price I can profit from. Hmm, maybe I should check if there's a mistake in the market data? But assuming the data is correct, there's no seller at a price below my true value yet.\n\nWait, the ask is 97.34, which is higher than my true value of 100. Wait, no, 97.34 is less than 100. Wait, 97.34 is the seller's price. So if I buy at 97.34, my profit would be 100 - 97.34 = $2.66 per lot. That's a profit. But there's only one seller at that price. However, the highest bid is 82.62, which is lower than the ask. So no trades are happening because the highest bid is below the lowest ask. So the market is in a state where there's no overlap between bids and asks.\n\nIn that case, my bid of 82.62 is not going to meet any ask. So I need to place a bid that can match an ask. But the only ask is 97.34. If I place a bid higher than 97.34, then my bid would be higher than the ask, which would result in a trade. Wait, but the bid is the price I'm willing to pay. So if I bid higher than the ask, the trade would happen. Wait, in a double auction, the highest bid that meets or exceeds the lowest ask would result in a trade. So if I place a bid of 97.34 or higher, then it would match the ask from Seller Kit. But my true value is 100, so I can afford to pay up to 100. So if I bid 97.34, the trade would happen at that price, giving me a profit of 2.66. Alternatively, maybe I could bid higher than that to see if there are other sellers, but there's only Kit.\n\nBut in this case, the existing bids are all below the ask. So, if I place a bid of 97.34, which is equal to the ask, then I can get a trade. However, the problem is that the existing bids are below that. So if I place a bid higher than 97.34, then I can get a trade. But the question is, should I do that? Let me think.\n\nWait, the current bid queue has my own bid at 82.62. If I want to get a trade, I need to place a bid that is at least as high as the ask. So, if I place a bid of 97.34, then it would be equal to the ask, and a trade would occur. That would be a good opportunity. However, the problem is that the current bid queue has other buyers. If I replace my bid with a higher one, maybe I can get the trade. But why would the other buyers not have done that? Because they might not have the true value to cover the ask. Wait, my true value is 100. So if I can buy at 97.34, that's a profit. But the other buyers have lower bids, which might not be profitable for them. So, maybe I should increase my bid to 97.34 to secure a trade.\n\nSo, in this case, the optimal bid for Hour 1 would be 97.34. That way, I can match the ask and get a trade. However, the problem is that the ask is 97.34, so if I place a bid of 97.34, the seller would accept that, and the trade would happen. But since the bid is equal to the ask, the trade would occur. Let me check that. In a double auction, when a bid meets or exceeds an ask, a trade happens. So yes, if I bid 97.34, the trade would happen. That would give me a profit of 100 - 97.34 = $2.66. That's better than not making a trade. \n\nBut wait, the existing bid queue has my bid at 82.62. If I place a bid of 97.34, that would replace my previous bid. So the bid queue would then have the other buyers at 81.31, 82.34, and me at 97.34. The ask is 97.34. So my bid would match the ask, and the trade occurs. That seems like the right move. But why would others not have done that? Maybe they don't know the true value. But in this case, my true value is 100, so I can afford to pay up to that. So placing a bid at 97.34 would be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a bid slightly higher than 97.34 to ensure that my bid is above the ask. But the problem is that the ask is fixed at 97.34. If I bid 97.34, it's equal. If I bid 97.35, it's higher. But since the ask is 97.34, either way, the trade would occur. However, the bid must be in whole cents. The current ask is 97.34, which is 97 dollars and 34 cents. So if I bid 97.34, that's acceptable. But can I bid 97.34? The rules say bids must be in whole cents, so yes. 97.34 is a valid bid.\n\nSo, the plan for Hour 1 is to place a bid of 97.34 to secure a trade. That would result in a profit of $2.66. This would be my first successful trade, and I can then adjust my strategy in subsequent hours based on the market's response.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that if I place a bid higher than the current ask, the trade would happen immediately. However, if I place a bid equal to the ask, the trade would also happen. So in this case, 97.34 is the correct bid. However, the existing bid from me is at 82.62. If I replace that with 97.34, that would be the new bid. Then, the trade would occur.\n\nSo, in this case, the reflection for this hour would be that I need to adjust my bid to match the ask to secure a trade. The plan is to bid at the ask price to get the trade. The new memory would note that I placed a bid of 97.34, which matched the ask and resulted in a trade. The scratch pad would update with the observation that the initial bids were low, the ask was high, so placing a bid at the ask price secured a trade."

  "plan_for_this_hour": "With the Ask Queue empty, there are no immediate opportunities for trade. Placing a bid at my true value of $100.00 ensures readiness for future asks without risking a loss.

My previous bid of $97.34 in Hour #1 did not match any asks due to this gap.#### Thoughts: Without active sellers, bids cannot be matched. However, placing a bid at my true value of $100.00 positions me to capitalize on future asks while avoiding losses.#### Updated Strategy: For this hour, I will bid at my true value of $100.00 to remain competitive. Future strategies should focus on timing bids with potential seller entries and adjusting to market gaps.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start by looking at the current market status. In Hour #2, the Bid Queue has entries from Buyer Ana at $82.63 and Buyer Nia at $97.34. The Ask Queue is empty, which is interesting. From the past trades, in Hour 1, there was a trade between Buyer Omar and Seller Kit at $89.98. But in the last 5 hours, Seller Kit had an ask of $82.62, and Buyer Ana bid $82.63, which probably matched that ask. Then Buyer Nia and Omar bid $97.34, but there were no asks at that level, so no trades happened there.\n\nWait, the Ask Queue is empty now. That means there are no current sellers. So, my bid of $97.34 in Hour 1 didn't match any asks because the Ask Queue was empty. But in the last 5 hours, there was an ask from Seller Kit at $82.62. But in the current status, the Ask Queue is empty. So maybe Seller Kit has already sold their lot, or maybe there are no other sellers in the market now.\n\nMy true value is $100 per lot. In Hour 1, I bid $97.34 to match the ask, but the actual trade happened at $89.98. Wait, why was that? Oh, because there was a seller (Seller Kit) who asked $82.62, but the bid from Buyer Ana was $82.63, which would match that ask. But how did the trade happen at $89.98? Maybe there was another seller with a higher ask that I matched? Wait, the past trades say Hour 1: Buyer Omar bought from Seller Kit at $89.98. But the asks in the last 5 hours for Hour 1 were Seller Kit's $82.62. That discrepancy is confusing. Maybe the $89.98 was a different ask from Seller Kit that wasn't listed in the 'Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours'? Or maybe there's a mistake in the data?\n\nAssuming the data is correct, the Ask Queue is empty now. So there are no current asks. Therefore, placing a bid now won't result in a trade unless a seller comes in. But since my true value is $100, maybe I should wait for an ask to appear. However, the problem is that I can only place one bid per hour. If I don't place a bid, I can't trade. But if I place a bid that's too low, maybe there's a chance someone else will match it. Alternatively, if I bid at $100, but there's no ask, I won't get a trade.\n\nWait, the Ask Queue is empty. So even if I bid $100, there's no one to match. So maybe the best strategy is to wait until there's an ask, then bid at that price. But since I can only place one bid per hour, I need to decide whether to place a bid now or not. However, the Ask Queue is empty, so placing a bid now won't result in a trade. So perhaps I should not place a bid now, or maybe place a bid at a higher price to potentially attract sellers. But since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe there are no sellers. Therefore, my only chance is to wait for an ask to appear. But how can I influence that? Maybe by placing a bid that's high enough to encourage sellers to come in. However, the rules state that I can only place one bid per hour. If I place a high bid, maybe that would signal to sellers that there's demand, but I don't know if that will bring them in. Alternatively, if I place a bid that's at my true value, $100, perhaps that would be a signal. But without any asks, it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Ask Queue is empty because all the sellers have already sold their lots. In that case, there's no trade possible unless new sellers come in. But as a buyer, I can't force a seller to come in. Therefore, in this scenario, I might not be able to make a trade in Hour 2. However, the goal is to secure maximum profitability by Hour 20. So maybe I need to be patient and wait for opportunities when there are asks. But the problem is that I need to make trades to accumulate profit. If I can't find any asks, then I can't trade. So in this case, perhaps the best move is to not place a bid this hour, but wait for the next hour when there might be asks again. However, the previous strategy was to bid at the ask price when there's one. But since there's no ask now, I can't do that. However, the user's instruction says that I can withdraw my previous bid. Wait, in Hour 1, I placed a bid of $97.34. But in the current Bid Queue, there's a bid from Buyer Nia at $97.34 and Buyer Ana at $82.63. So my previous bid might still be in the queue. But since the Ask Queue is empty, that bid is not matched. So maybe I should withdraw my previous bid to free up resources, or maybe keep it in case an ask appears later. But the Ask Queue is empty now, so maybe the best is to not place a new bid and just wait. However, the problem says that I must propose a bid each hour. Wait, the rules say \"You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.\" So, I have the option to either place a new bid, replace the previous one, or withdraw. So in this case, since there's no ask, maybe I should not place a bid, or place a higher one. But the previous strategy was to bid at the ask price. However, the Ask Queue is empty. So perhaps I should not place a bid now, but maybe withdraw the previous bid to avoid holding a bid that might not be matched. Alternatively, if I leave the previous bid, maybe in the next hour, someone places an ask, and my bid is still there. But in this case, the Ask Queue is empty, so maybe there's no trade. But the user's instruction says that in Hour 1, the bid of $97.34 was placed, but the trade happened at $89.98. That's confusing. Wait, the Past Trades for Hour 1 says Buyer Omar bought from Seller Kit at $89.98. But the Asks/Bids in the last 5 hours for Hour 1 include Seller Kit's ask at $82.62. So there's a discrepancy here. How did the trade happen at $89.98 if the ask was $82.62? That suggests that maybe there was another ask from Seller Kit at $89.98 that wasn't listed in the Asks/Bids section. Or perhaps the data is inconsistent. This is a bit confusing, but maybe I should focus on the current market status.\n\nGiven that the Ask Queue is empty, I can't match any bid. Therefore, in Hour 2, the best action is to either not place a bid or place a high bid to potentially attract sellers. But since the Ask Queue is empty, there's no seller. So perhaps the best is to wait and not place a bid. But the rules require me to propose a bid each hour. So I can choose to place a bid, but if there's no ask, it won't result in a trade. Therefore, maybe I should place a bid at a higher price, say $100, to show willingness to pay more, which might encourage sellers to come in. However, since I can only place one bid per hour, and the Ask Queue is empty, this might not be effective. Alternatively, I could place a bid at $97.34 again, but that's the same as before. However, in Hour 1, that bid didn't result in a trade because the Ask Queue was empty. So repeating the same bid might not help. Alternatively, withdraw the previous bid to avoid having a bid that's not matched. But the user's previous strategy was to place a bid at the ask price. However, in this case, there's no ask. So perhaps the plan is to wait for an ask to appear, and then bid at that price. But since I can't predict when that will happen, maybe I need to adjust my strategy.\n\nAnother angle: the true value is $100, so I can afford to pay up to $100. If there's an ask at $97.34, I can make a $2.66 profit. But if I bid $100, and an ask comes in at $100, I'd make $0 profit. However, if there's no ask, the bid doesn't result in a trade. So the optimal is to bid just below my true value to maximize profit if a trade occurs. But without knowing the asks, it's tricky. In the absence of asks, maybe I should not place a bid to conserve the ability to bid higher when an ask appears. But the problem requires that I place a bid each hour. Therefore, I have to choose a bid. Given that, if I place a bid at $100, and there's an ask at $100, I get a trade with $0 profit. But if there's an ask at $97, I can still match it. But since the Ask Queue is empty, this might not help. Alternatively, maybe the Ask Queue will have entries in future hours. But I can't predict that. So the safest strategy is to place a bid at $100, which is my true value, ensuring that if an ask comes in at or below $100, I can make a profit. However, if the ask is above $100, I can't make a trade. But since my true value is $100, I can't afford to pay more than that. Therefore, placing a bid at $100 is the maximum I can do without risking losing money. But the problem is that in the current market, there are no asks, so the bid won't result in a trade. But maybe in future hours, there will be asks. Therefore, placing a bid at $100 now would be a good strategy. But the reflection from previous hours is that the initial bid was too low. So in Hour 2, I should adjust to place a higher bid to avoid being too low again. However, in this case, since there's no ask, even a high bid won't result in a trade. So perhaps the best is to not place a bid, but the rules require a bid. Therefore, maybe I should place a bid at $100, which is my true value. That way, if an ask appears in the future, I can make a trade. Alternatively, if I withdraw the previous bid, I can place a new one. But the previous bid was at $97.34. If I withdraw it, I can place a new bid. However, the Ask Queue is empty, so it's a gamble. \n\nIn conclusion, the bid for this hour should be $100.00, as that's the maximum I can pay without losing money. This way, if an ask appears in the future, I can secure a trade. Even though there's no ask now, it's a strategic move to be ready when the market changes. The reflection should note that in Hour 1, the bid was too low to match the ask, but now with the Ask Queue empty, the approach needs to be different. The plan is to place a bid at $100 to maximize potential profit when an ask appears. The new memory would state that in Hour 2, the bid was $100.00, and the Ask Queue remained empty. The scratch pad update would adjust the strategy to focus on higher bids given the lack of asks."

However, placing a bid at my true value of $100.00 positions me to capitalize on future asks while avoiding losses.#### Updated Strategy: For this hour, I will bid at my true value of $100.00 to remain competitive. Future strategies should focus on timing bids with potential seller entries and adjusting to market gaps.

That gave a profit of $2.66 per lot. But in Hour 2, even though I bid $100.00, there were no asks, so no trade happened. The problem here was that I didn't check if there were any sellers present. The Ask Queue was empty, so my bid couldn't match anything.\n\nNow, looking at the current status for Hour 3, the Bid Queue has entries from Buyer Ana at $83.0 and Buyer Nia at $100.0. The Ask Queue is empty again. The past trades were in Hours 1 and 2 with Seller Kit. The successful trades so far are those two. \n\nThe challenge is that without any asks, even if I place a bid, there's no seller to match with. However, my true value is $100.00. If I bid at $100.00, I might be waiting for a seller to come in, but if there's no seller, then no trade. But maybe there's a chance that other sellers might enter the market in future hours. However, since I can only place one bid per hour, I need to decide if I should place a bid at my true value or maybe lower it to try to match any potential asks that might come in.\n\nBut considering the Ask Queue is empty now, placing a bid at $100.00 might not lead to a trade this hour. However, if I don't bid, I might miss out if a seller comes in. But since there's no ask now, I can't get a trade. Alternatively, if I bid at a lower price, but that would decrease my profit margin. However, if a seller comes in at $100.00, then I could get a trade. But if I bid lower, I might get a trade if a seller comes in at that price, but I risk lower profit.\n\nWait, the objective is to secure maximum profitability by the end of Hour 20. So, I need to balance between getting trades and maximizing profit. If I bid at $100.00, I might get a trade if a seller comes in, but if I bid lower, I might get more trades but with lower profit. But in the current state, since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe I should just bid at my true value and wait for any potential seller entries. Alternatively, maybe I should not bid at all this hour, but that would mean not participating in the market. However, the problem is that in the next hours, if I don't bid, I might miss out on any possible asks that come in. \n\nBut since the Ask Queue is empty now, and I can't see any sellers in the Ask Queue, there's no immediate opportunity. Therefore, placing a bid at $100.00 is a way to stay competitive for future hours. Even though there's no trade this hour, it's better to be ready for when a seller appears. So, my plan is to place a bid at $100.00 this hour. \n\nIn the scratchpad update, I should note that the Ask Queue is empty again, so no immediate trade. The strategy remains to bid at true value to be ready for any future asks. The new memory for this hour is that I placed a bid of $100.00, but no trade occurred because the Ask Queue"

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user is Buyer Omar, negotiating in a continuous double auction for heavy metals. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the current market status. The Bid Queue has entries from Buyer Ana at 83.5 and Buyer Nia at 100.0. The Ask Queue is empty, which means no sellers are currently active. In the past three hours, the Ask Queue was also empty except for Hour 1 when there was an ask from Seller Kit. However, in Hour 3, the Ask Queue was empty again, and Omar bid 100.0 but no trade happened.\n\nThe successful trades so far were in Hours 1, 2, and 3, where Omar bought from Seller Kit at decreasing prices (89.98, 98.67, 100.0). Wait, the last one was at 100.0, which is the true value. But in Hour 3, the ask was 100.0 from Seller Kit, and Omar's bid was 100.0, so that's a match. But the profit there would be 100.0 (true value) minus the price paid. Wait, if the true value is $100.00 per lot, then buying at 100.0 would mean zero profit. But in Hour 3, the trade was at 100.0, which might not be profitable. However, the user's previous reflection mentioned that in Hour 3, the bid was 100.0 but no trades occurred. Wait, but the Past Trades show that Hour 3 had a trade at 100.0. That seems conflicting. Maybe the Ask Queue was empty, but Seller Kit had an ask of 100.0 in Hour 3, which was matched with Omar's bid. So that trade happened.\n\nNow, for Hour 4, the Ask Queue is still empty. The current strategy is to bid at the true value of 100.0 each hour. But in Hour 3, that bid did result in a trade. However, the Ask Queue was empty in the current status, so maybe Seller Kit hasn't placed an ask yet. \n\nThe reflection needs to look at past outcomes. In Hour 1, bidding 97.34 matched the ask and made a profit. In Hours 2 and 3, bidding at 100.0 didn't result in a trade until Hour 3, where it did. But maybe the Ask Queue dynamics are important. If the Ask Queue is empty, then even a bid at 100.0 won't result in a trade unless a seller comes in. \n\nThe plan for this hour is to continue bidding at the true value of 100.0. Since the Ask Queue is empty, there's no immediate trade, but maintaining the bid ensures that when a seller comes in, the bid is there to capture the trade. The user's previous strategy was to stay at 100.0, which seems logical. \n\nThe new_memory for Hour 4 would be that the bid was placed at 100.0, and since the Ask Queue is empty, no trade occurred. The scratch pad update should note that the Ask Queue is still empty, so the strategy remains to bid at true value and monitor for seller activity. \n\nI need to make sure the bid is a floating-point value with two decimal places, like 100.00. The previous bid in Hour 3 was 100.0, which is equivalent to 100.00. So the current bid should be 100.00. The reflection should note that in Hour 3, there was a successful trade when the Ask Queue had an entry, but in this hour, it's empty again. The plan is to stick with the true value bid. \n\nPotential issues: If the Ask Queue remains empty, the bid at 100.00 isn't profitable, but it's necessary to be ready when sellers appear. The user's true value is 100.00, so there's no loss in bidding at that level, but the profit would be zero if a trade occurs at that price. However, if the seller is willing to sell at a lower price, the bid at 100.00 would still capture the trade, but the profit might be less. However, the user's strategy is to maximize profitability, not just the number of trades. So maybe there's a balance needed. But the previous actions show that the user is willing to bid at true value to secure any possible trade, even if it's at zero profit. \n\nSo the JSON output would have \"bid\": 100.00, and the new_memory would state that in Hour 4, the bid was placed at 100.00 with no trades as the Ask Queue was empty. The scratch pad would be updated to note the current state and reaffirm the"

  "_thinking": "Okay, let me start by reviewing the previous hours to see what's working and what's not. In Hour 1, I bid $97.34 and matched the ask, making a profit. Then in Hours 2-4, I kept bidding $100.00, but there were no asks, so no trades. The Ask Queue was empty each time. The past trades show that in Hour 2, I bought at $98.67, which was a lower price than my true value. Wait, no, my true value is $100.00. So in Hour 2, I actually bought at a lower price, which was better. But in Hours 3 and 4, I bought at $100.00, which is my true value, so no profit there. But why did the seller Kit keep asking $100.00? Maybe they're trying to get the maximum price.\n\nNow looking at the current state: the Bid Queue has two entries, 98.67 from Ana and 100.00 from Nia. The Ask Queue is empty. So if I place a bid of $100.00, there's no one to match with. But if I lower my bid, say to 99.00, maybe I can match if a seller comes in. However, my true value is $100.00, so I don't want to pay more than that. But if I bid lower, I might get a better price if a seller appears. However, the problem is that I need to secure a trade. Since the Ask Queue is empty, I need to wait for sellers to come in. But if I keep bidding at $100.00, when a seller comes in at $100.00, I can match. Alternatively, maybe I should adjust my bid slightly below $100.00 to be more competitive if there's a seller with a lower ask. But the previous asks from Kit were at $100.00. So maybe the sellers are also at $100.00. \n\nWait, in Hour 4, Seller Kit asked $100.00, and Buyer Omar bought at that price. So that's a trade at the true value. So if I keep bidding $100.00, and if Seller Kit comes back with another ask, I can match. However, the Ask Queue is empty now. So maybe the seller hasn't placed an ask yet. \n\nBut I need to decide on my bid for Hour 5. If I keep bidding $100.00, there's no trade. But if I lower it to, say, 99.99, maybe I can get a trade if a seller comes in. However, the risk is that if a seller comes in at $100.00, my bid of 99.99 would not match. But if I bid exactly at $100.00, when a seller comes in at $100.00, I can match. Since the true value is $100.00, I shouldn't pay more, but if I can get the same price, that's the best. \n\nSo the strategy is to keep bidding at $100.00 to be ready when a seller appears. Since the Ask Queue is empty, there's no immediate trade, but the previous hours show that Seller Kit might come back with an ask. So the plan is to stick with $100.00. \n\nBut why did in Hour 2, the bid at $100.00 didn't get a trade? Because the Ask Queue was empty. So maybe there are no sellers yet. But in Hour 2, Seller Kit had an ask of $97.34, but when I bid $100.00, that was higher than the ask, so maybe the ask was already filled. Wait, the past trades show that in Hour 2, I bought at $98.67. That might have been a lower ask. \n\nHmm, but in the current situation, the Ask Queue is empty. So perhaps there are no active asks. Therefore, even if I bid $100.00, there's nothing to match. So I need to either wait for a seller to come in or adjust my bid. But if I lower my bid, I might get a trade if a seller comes in at a lower price. However, the risk is that I might not get the maximum profit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the Ask Queue is empty, and I need to wait. However, the market rules allow me to place a bid once per hour. So if I keep placing $100.00, when a seller comes in, I can match. So the updated plan is to continue bidding at $100.00, as per the previous strategy. \n\nTherefore, for Hour 5, I'll bid $100.00 again, hoping that a seller comes in. If not, proceed similarly. The reflection is that previous bids at $100.00 didn't result in trades because the Ask Queue was empty, but the strategy is correct to maintain the bid at true value. So the plan is to continue with $100.00."

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue is still empty, reinforcing the need to maintain a bid at the true value of $100.00 to be ready for potential seller entries.#### Thoughts: Bidding at the true value ensures profitability when a seller appears, even if it means waiting for the Ask Queue to populate. Patience is key in this phase.#### Updated Strategy: Continue placing bids at $100.00 per hour to remain competitive. If seller activity increases, consider slight downward adjustments to improve match probability, but only if the Ask Queue reflects lower prices.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm Buyer Omar for Solaris Energy, and I need to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20. The market rules say I can place one bid per hour, and my true value is $100 per lot. The goal is to secure trades at a price that gives me the best profit.\n\nLooking at the previous hours, I see that in Hour 1, I bid $97.34 and matched with Seller Kit's ask at $97.34, making a $2.66 profit. Then in Hours 2 through 5, I kept bidding $100.00, but the Ask Queue was empty except for Seller Kit's asks at $100.00. However, in those hours, I still managed to make trades, probably because Seller Kit was active. Wait, looking at the past trades, in Hours 2-5, I bought from Seller Kit at $98.67, $100.0, $100.0, $100.0. Hmm, but in Hour 2, the Ask Queue was empty? Wait, the market status for Hour 2's Ask Queue was empty, but there was a Seller Kit ask at $97.34. Maybe the Ask Queue was empty except for that? Or maybe the data is showing that the Ask Queue was empty when I placed my bid, but Seller Kit entered an ask later?\n\nWait, the Market Status for the last 5 hours shows that in each hour, Seller Kit had an ask. For example, in Hour 2, Seller Kit asked $97.34, but the Ask Queue was empty? That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the Ask Queue is the current state at the time of the hour's check. So in Hour 2, when I placed my bid of $100.00, the Ask Queue was empty, but Seller Kit might have placed an ask later in the hour, leading to a trade. But the data shows that in Hour 2, the Ask Queue was empty, but there was a Seller Kit ask. Maybe the Ask Queue is the state after all bids and asks in that hour. Or maybe the Ask Queue is the state when the bid was placed. This is a bit confusing.\n\nBut regardless, the key is that in Hours 2-5, even though I bid $100.00, there were trades happening, which suggests that Seller Kit was placing asks at $100.00, and my bid matched those. However, in Hour 5, the Ask Queue was empty, but I still made a trade. Maybe the Ask Queue is updated after the bids are placed. So, if I place a bid, and then a seller comes in with an ask, the trade happens immediately. But the Ask Queue status might be the state before the bid is placed. So, in Hour 5, the Ask Queue was empty when I placed my bid, but Seller Kit might have placed an ask after, leading to a trade. However, the past trades show that in Hour 5, I bought from Seller Kit at $100.0, which would mean that Seller Kit had an ask at $100.0.\n\nNow, moving to Hour 6. The current status of the Bid Queue is [(100.0, 'Buyer Ana'), (100.0, 'Buyer Nia')]. The Ask Queue is empty. So, I need to place a bid. The previous strategy was to keep bidding $100.00 to be ready for any seller entries. However, since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe there's no immediate seller. But if I keep bidding $100.00, when a seller comes in, the trade will happen. However, if the Ask Queue is empty, maybe there's no seller active yet.\n\nWait, but in the past, even when the Ask Queue was empty, I still got trades. So perhaps the Ask Queue is not the only way for sellers to enter. Maybe the sellers place their asks, but they are not visible in the Ask Queue until they are placed. So, if I keep my bid at $100.00, and a seller comes in with an ask at $100.00, the trade will happen. However, if I bid higher than the seller's ask, the trade occurs at the seller's price. But since my true value is $100.00, I can't afford to go above that. So, if I bid at $100.00, and a seller is willing to sell at $100.00, we match. If the seller is willing to sell lower, but I bid $100.00, I can't get a better price. But since my true value is $100.00, any trade at $100.00 gives me zero profit, but if a seller is willing to sell lower, I can make a profit. However, if I bid lower, I risk not getting a trade if the seller's ask is higher than my bid.\n\nBut the problem is that in previous hours, when I bid $100.00 and the Ask Queue was empty, I still made trades. That suggests that sellers are entering with asks at $100.00. So, maybe the Ask Queue is not the only place where sellers are active. Perhaps the Ask Queue is the list of current asks, but if a seller comes in with an ask, it's added to the queue. However, if the Ask Queue is empty, it means no current asks, but maybe sellers are about to enter. But I can't know that. So, the best strategy is to stay at the true value of $100.00, so that when a seller comes in, the trade can be made. However, if the Ask Queue is empty, there's no seller active, so no trade. But in previous hours, even with the Ask Queue empty, I made trades. That's confusing. Maybe the Ask Queue is a snapshot at the time of the bid, but sellers can enter later in the hour. So, in Hour 6, the Ask Queue is empty, but there's a chance that a seller will come in, and my bid of $100.00 would match.\n\nBut if I bid $100.00 and the Ask Queue is empty, there's no immediate trade. However, if I lower my bid slightly, say $99.99, and a seller comes in with an ask at $100.00, my bid is below their ask, so no trade. But if the seller is willing to sell at $99.99, then the trade happens. However, I don't know the seller's ask. So, perhaps the optimal is to keep the bid at $100.00 to maximize the chance of matching any seller that comes in. Even if it's a zero profit, but if the seller is willing to sell at $100.00, then I can secure the trade. But since my true value is $100.00, I can't make a profit, but maybe I can avoid missing out on a trade if the seller comes in with a lower ask. However, if I bid $100.00, and the seller comes in with $99.50, I can't match because my bid is higher. Wait, no. In a double auction, the highest bid matches the lowest ask. So if I have a bid of $100.00, and a seller comes in with an ask of $99.50, then my bid is higher than their ask, so the trade happens at $99.50. That would give me a profit of $0.50 per lot. But if I bid $100.00, and the seller is willing to sell at $99.50, I can make a profit. However, if I lower my bid to $99.50, then I can only match sellers who are willing to sell at $99.50 or lower, but if a seller comes in with a higher ask, say $99.60, my bid would be lower, and the trade wouldn't happen. So, there's a trade-off.\n\nBut in the previous hours, when I bid $100.00, I made trades even when the Ask Queue was empty. That suggests that the seller's asks were at $100.00. So, if I keep bidding $100.00, I can match those sellers. But if the seller is willing to sell lower, I could make a profit. However, without knowing the seller's ask, it's risky to lower the bid. Therefore, the strategy is to stay at $100.00 to secure any available seller, even if it's at zero profit, but if the seller comes in with a lower ask, I can still profit. Alternatively, maybe there's a chance that lowering the bid slightly could increase the chance of a trade if the seller is willing to sell lower. But without data on the seller's behavior, it's hard to predict.\n\nIn Hour 6, the Ask Queue is empty, so no current asks. But I need to place a bid. The previous strategy was to keep bidding $100.00. So, I should do that again. However, the reflection might suggest that in previous hours, even with the Ask Queue empty, there were trades. So, maybe the Ask Queue is not the only indicator. The key is to stay at the true value to maximize the chance of matching any seller that comes in. Therefore, the bid for Hour 6 i"

This balances immediate profit potential against the likelihood of seller activity at that price point.\n#### Updated Strategy: Continue placing $100.00 bids. Reassess if seller asks consistently deviate below $100.00, but no changes are needed for now.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's think through this. So, the user is Buyer Omar, and they need to decide their bid for Hour 7. The main goal is to maximize profitability by Hour 20. Let's start by reviewing the past data.\n\nLooking at the previous hours, from Hour 1 to 6, Omar has been placing bids at $100.00 each time. The Ask Queue has been empty in Hours 2-6, but there were trades in each of those hours. Wait, how did that happen? Oh, because in Hour 1, the bid was $97.34 which matched the ask of $97.34. Then in subsequent hours, even though the Ask Queue was empty, there were trades. But how? Maybe the asks were placed later in the hour, so when Omar placed his bid at $100, the seller might have entered later, and the bid matched. But the Ask Queue was empty when he placed the bid. So maybe the system allows for asks to be placed after the bid, leading to a trade. \n\nNow, looking at the current status for Hour 7. The Bid Queue has two entries at $100.00 from Buyer Ana and Nia. The Ask Queue is empty. The past trades show that in Hours 2-6, even with the Ask Queue empty, Omar got trades. So perhaps the seller (like Seller Kit) is entering asks at $100.00 later in the hour. But in the last 5 hours, Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00 each hour. Wait, in the \"Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours\" section, for each hour from 2 to 6, Seller Kit has an ask of $100.00. So maybe the seller is consistently placing asks at $100.00 each hour, but the Ask Queue might be empty when Omar bids, but then the seller enters their ask later, leading to a match.\n\nIn Hour 6, the Ask Queue was empty, but Omar still made a trade at $100.00. So the system might process the bid and the ask even if they are placed in the same hour, as long as the ask is placed after the bid. But the Ask Queue is empty when Omar places his bid. So the timing is crucial here. If the seller places an ask at $100.00 after Omar's bid, then the trade happens. But if the seller doesn't place an ask, then no trade.\n\nSo the previous strategy was to keep bidding $100.00. However, in Hour 1, Omar got a profit by bidding lower. But since the true value is $100.00, maybe the optimal is to bid at $100.00 to capture any seller at that price. However, if the seller is consistently placing asks at $100.00, then bidding $100.00 would result in zero profit, but securing a trade. If the seller's ask is higher, say $101.00, then Omar would need to bid higher to get a trade, but that would reduce profit. However, the problem states that the true value is $100.00, so any bid above that would lead to a loss, but if the ask is at $100.00, then the profit is zero.\n\nBut the previous trades in Hours 2-6 all resulted in trades at $100.00, which gives zero profit (since the true value is $100.00). However, in Hour 1, Omar got a $2.66 profit by bidding $97.34. But since the Ask Queue was empty in subsequent hours, perhaps the seller is only entering asks at $100.00, which means Omar can't get a profit unless he lowers his bid below $100.00. But if he does that, he might miss out on the trade if the seller's ask is at $100.00. \n\nWait, the problem says that the true value is $100.00, so the maximum profit per lot is $100.00 minus the purchase price. But if Omar buys at $100.00, profit is zero. But if the seller's ask is above $100.00, then Omar can't make a profit. However, in the previous hours, the seller's ask was $100.00, so Omar's profit was zero. But in Hour 1, the seller's ask was $97.34, which allowed Omar to make a profit. \n\nSo the key here is to determine if the seller is going to place asks at $100.00 or higher in the upcoming hours. If the seller is consistently placing asks at $100.00, then Omar should bid $100.00 to secure the trade with zero profit. If there's a chance that the seller might place a lower ask, then Omar might want to lower his bid slightly to capture that. But given the consistent asks at $100.00 in previous hours, it's likely that the seller will continue to do so. \n\nIn Hour 7, the Ask Queue is empty. So if Omar bids $100.00 again, and the seller places an ask at $100.00, the trade will happen. If not, no trade. But since in the past, the seller has been placing asks at $100.00 each hour, even if the Ask Queue was empty when Omar bid, it's reasonable to continue with $100.00. \n\nAlternatively, Omar could try to lower his bid slightly to see if the seller is willing to sell at a lower price. For example, bidding $99.99. But that might risk missing the trade if the seller's ask is $100.00. However, the profit would be $0.01 per lot, which is minimal. But if the seller is not placing asks below $100.00, then this would result in no trade. \n\nBut given the previous pattern, where the seller's ask is at $100.00, and Omar's bid at $100.00 results in a trade, even with zero profit, it's better to continue with that strategy. The profit is not negative, and the goal is to secure as many trades as possible to accumulate profit over the 20 hours. \n\nSo the plan for Hour 7 is to maintain the $100.00 bid. The reflection would note that previous bids at $100.00 have secured trades even when the Ask Queue was empty, likely because the seller placed asks later in the hour. The plan is to continue this strategy, assuming the seller will do the same in Hour 7. The new memory would note that in Hour 7, Omar placed a bid of $100.00, and the Ask Queue was empty, but the seller might enter later. The scratch pad would update the observations and strategy accordingly."

Hour 6: You bought from Seller Kit at $100.0
Hour 7: You bought from Seller Kit at $100.0





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue remains empty, but historical data shows sellers (e.g., Seller Kit) consistently enter asks at $100.00 later in the hour, enabling trades despite initial emptiness.
#### Thoughts: Sticking to $100.00 ensures trade participation without risking losses. This balances immediate profit potential against the likelihood of seller activity at that price point.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue placing $100.00 bids. Reassess if seller asks consistently deviate below $100.00, but no changes are needed for now.

Monitor for any deviation in Seller Kit's ask price below $100.00, but no changes are needed for now.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's break down what's happening here. I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #8. Let's start by looking at the previous hours. From Hour 1 to 7, Buyer Omar has been placing bids at $100.00, and there were trades happening because Seller Kit was asking $100.00 each time. However, in some hours like Hour 2, the Ask Queue was empty initially, but Seller Kit entered later. \n\nNow, looking at the current status for Hour 8: the Bid Queue has entries from Buyer Nia at $99.99 and Buyer Ana at $100.00. The Ask Queue is empty. But in the past, Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00 later in the hour. So, even though the Ask Queue is empty now, there's a chance Seller Kit will enter an ask at $100.00 soon.\n\nThe previous strategy was to bid $100.00 because that's the price where Seller Kit has been asking, ensuring trades. However, in the Bid Queue, there's a bid from Buyer Nia at $99.99. If I bid $100.00, my bid would be higher than Nia's, but if Seller Kit comes in at $100.00, I would get the trade. But maybe there's a way to adjust the bid slightly to capture a better price if the seller's ask is lower? Wait, but the seller's asks have been exactly $100.00. If I bid lower than $100.00, say $99.99, but there's already a bid at that price from Nia. If the seller comes in at $100.00, then Nia's bid would be the one that matches, and I wouldn't get the trade. So, to secure the trade, I need to bid at least $100.00 to be the highest bid when the seller enters.\n\nBut in Hour 7, Buyer Nia bid $99.99, and Buyer Omar bid $100.00, and there was a trade at $100.00. So, even with Nia's lower bid, the seller's ask was at $100.00, so Omar's bid would match. Therefore, sticking with $100.00 is the right move. \n\nWait, but the current Bid Queue shows Buyer Nia has a bid at $99.99 and Buyer Ana at $100.00. If I bid $100.00, my bid would be the same as Ana's. But since the seller comes in at $100.00, both Ana and Omar's bids would match. However, since bids are processed in the order they are placed, maybe Ana's bid is earlier. But the problem is that the system might take the highest bid, so if there are multiple bids at $100.00, the one that's placed first would get priority. But the market rules don't specify the order, just that placing a bid replaces the previous one. So, if I bid $100.00, I might be competing with Ana's bid. But since the Ask Queue is empty, the seller is expected to come in at $100.00, so either bid at $100.00 would work. However, since Ana is already at $100.00, perhaps I should consider if my bid is redundant. But the system allows placing the same bid, and it replaces the previous one. Wait, the user can place a bid that replaces their previous one. So if I place $100.00 again, it would replace my previous bid. But if Ana is already there, maybe the seller would match with Ana's bid first. However, the user's goal is to secure the trade, so even if Ana's bid is there, placing a $100.00 bid would still be necessary to have a chance. But since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe there's a chance the seller hasn't entered yet, and if I bid $100.00, I might get the trade when the seller comes in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the seller is expected to come in at $100.00, so the best bid is $100.00. Therefore, the plan is to bid $100.00 again. The reflection should note that previous bids at $100.00 have been successful, and the Ask Queue is expected to fill. The new memory would state that in Hour 8, the bid was $100.00 and the Ask Queue remained empty, but the strategy remains the same. The scratch pad should update the observations and confirm the strategy."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match the ask price of $97.34, securing a trade that generated a $2.66 profit per lot.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I bid $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, resulting in no trades. This highlights the need to monitor for seller entries in future hours.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $100.00, but no trades occurred as the Ask Queue remained empty.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $100.00, but no trades occurred as the Ask Queue remained empty.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no immediate trades despite consistent bidding at the true value.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but past patterns suggest a seller may enter later in the hour.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but historical patterns indicate Seller Kit will enter at $100.00 later in the hour.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's break down what's happening here. So, I'm Buyer Omar for Solaris Energy in this continuous double auction. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20. My true value per lot is $100, so I need to make sure my bids are set in a way that secures trades without sacrificing too much profit.\n\nLooking at the past hours, especially Hours 1 through 8, I see a pattern. Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00 later in each hour. Even when the Ask Queue was initially empty, Seller Kit's ask came in at $100.00, allowing me to make a trade. My previous bids at $100.00 have consistently matched that, leading to profits. For example, Hour 1 had a lower price, but from Hour 3 onward, the trades were at $100.00, resulting in a $0 profit but securing the trade. However, in Hour 2, when I bid $100.00 but there were no asks, I didn't get a trade. But that was because Seller Kit hadn't entered yet.\n\nNow, looking at the current status for Hour 9. The Bid Queue has two entries at $100.00 from Buyer Ana and Nia. The Ask Queue is empty. The past five hours show that Seller Kit's asks have been at $100.00, even though in some hours like Hour 7, Buyer Nia had a bid at $99.99 but Seller Kit still asked at $100.00. So, the key here is that Seller Kit's predictable ask at $100.00 means that if I bid $100.00, there's a high chance of a trade once Seller Kit enters the market.\n\nBut wait, the current Bid Queue already has two bids at $100.00. If I place another bid at $100.00, it might not be necessary. However, since the Ask Queue is empty now, maybe Seller Kit hasn't entered yet. But based on past patterns, Seller Kit usually enters later in the hour. So, if I place a bid at $100.00, once Seller Kit's ask comes in, my bid will match and I'll get the trade. However, since there are already two bids at $100.00, maybe I don't need to place another one. But the problem is that in the previous hours, even with multiple bids at $100.00, Seller Kit's ask still came in, and the bids would have been matched. But since the Ask Queue is currently empty, perhaps I need to ensure that my bid is in place when Seller Kit enters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that if I place a bid lower than $100.00, I might get a better price if Seller Kit's ask is lower. But according to the past data, Seller Kit's asks have been exactly $100.00. So deviating from that might not be beneficial. Also, if I bid lower, I might not get a trade because Seller Kit is asking $100.00. But if I bid higher than $100.00, that would be overpaying. So sticking at $100.00 seems optimal.\n\nIn the current hour, the Ask Queue is empty. The last five hours show that Seller Kit's ask was at $100.00. So, if I place a bid at $100.00, when Seller Kit comes in, the trade will happen. However, since there are already two bids at $100.00, maybe my bid isn't needed. But since the system allows placing a bid each hour, maybe I should still place it to ensure that my bid is in the queue in case there's a tie or if the existing bids are withdrawn. Alternatively, maybe the existing bids are from other buyers, and I need to make sure that my bid is present.\n\nWait, but the rules say that each hour, I can place a new bid which replaces the previous one. But in this case, the current Bid Queue has two entries. If I place a bid of $100.00, it would replace my previous bid (if any). However, the existing bids are from Ana and Nia. So if I place another bid at $100.00, it would add to the Bid Queue? Wait, the Bid Queue is a list of all bids. So if I place a bid at $100.00, that would be added to the Bid Queue. So the Bid Queue would have Ana, Nia, and Omar at $100.00. But in the current status, the Bid Queue is [(100.0, 'Buyer Ana'), (100.0, 'Buyer Nia')]. So if I place a bid of $100.00, it would be added to the queue. However, the Ask Queue is empty. So until Seller Kit comes in with an ask at $100.00, there's no trade.\n\nBut according to the past pattern, Seller Kit's ask comes in later in the hour. So, if I place a bid at $100.00, when Seller Kit's ask arrives, the trade will happen. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to place a bid at $100.00 again. Even though there are existing bids at $100.00, adding another bid might not hurt, as it's the same price. So I should place a bid of $100.00 again.\n\nBut looking at the scratchpad, the previous strategy was to continue placing $100.00. The reflection should note that in previous hours, even with multiple bids, Seller Kit's asks were at $100.00, so the strategy holds. The plan is to stick with $100.00. The new memory would note that in Hour 9, the bid was $100.00 and the Ask Queue was empty, but the strategy remains. The scratchpad update would confirm the observations and thoughts."

Monitor for any deviation in Seller Kit\u2019s ask price below $100.00, but no changes are needed for now.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle Hour #10. First, looking at the previous hours, Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00 later in each hour. Even though there were other buyers like Ana and Nia bidding at $100.00, the Ask Queue was still empty until Seller Kit entered. In Hour 9, the Ask Queue was empty, but Seller Kit came in at $100.00. The successful trades from Hour 1 to 9 show that when the bid matches Seller Kit's ask at $100.00, a trade happens. \n\nIn the current status for Hour 10, the Bid Queue has Buyer Ana and Nia at $100.00. The Ask Queue is empty. The past 5 hours show that Seller Kit's asks are consistently at $100.00. The previous strategy was to bid $100.00 to match Seller Kit's ask when they enter. But since the Ask Queue is empty now, maybe Seller Kit hasn't entered yet. However, historical patterns suggest they'll come in later in the hour. \n\nThe challenge is that if I bid $100.00 now, there's no seller, so no trade. But if I wait, maybe Seller Kit will come in. However, the rules say I can only place one bid per hour, which replaces the previous one. So if I don't bid now, I might miss the opportunity if Seller Kit comes in later. But the previous hours show that even when others bid $100.00, Seller Kit still comes in at $100.00, leading to a trade. \n\nWait, in the past, when multiple buyers bid $100.00, Seller Kit's ask was at $100.00, so the trade happened. But if I bid $100.00 again, and Seller Kit comes in, then the trade would be executed. However, since the Ask Queue is empty now, maybe Seller Kit hasn't entered yet. But according to the historical data, Seller Kit has been entering at $100.00 later in the hour. So placing a bid at $100.00 now would be the same as previous hours. \n\nBut in Hour 1, the bid was $97.34 and matched the ask, making a profit. However, from Hour 2 onwards, bidding at $100.00 led to trades only when Seller Kit entered. So the key is to have a bid at $100.00 when Seller Kit comes in. Therefore, even though the Ask Queue is empty now, placing a bid at $100.00 would be the optimal strategy. \n\nSo, for Hour 10, I should place a bid of $100.00 again. The reflection is that sticking to $100.00 maximizes the chance of matching Seller Kit's ask when they enter. The plan is to continue this strategy. The new memory would note that in Hour 10, a bid of $100.00 was placed, and the Ask Queue remained empty, but Seller Kit may enter later. The scratch pad update would reinforce the existing strategy, noting that Seller Kit's consistent $100.00 asks make this the optimal bid."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match the ask price of $97.34, securing a trade that generated a $2.66 profit per lot.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I bid $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, resulting in no trades. This highlights the need to monitor for seller entries in future hours.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $100.00, but no trades occurred as the Ask Queue remained empty.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $100.00, but no trades occurred as the Ask Queue remained empty.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no immediate trades despite consistent bidding at the true value.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but past patterns suggest a seller may enter later in the hour.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but historical patterns indicate Seller Kit will enter at $100.00 later in the hour.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but historical patterns indicate Seller Kit will enter at $100.00 later in the hour.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but Seller Kit is expected to enter later in the hour as per historical patterns.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller Kit’s asks have consistently appeared at $100.00 later in the hour, regardless of initial Ask Queue status. Competing bids at $100.00 (e.g., Buyer Ana, Nia) do not affect this dynamic.
#### Thoughts: Sticking to $100.00 maximizes trade probability while maintaining a $0 profit margin, which is optimal given Seller Kit’s behavior. Lower bids risk missed trades; higher bids reduce profit.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue placing $100.00 bids. Monitor for any deviation in Seller Kit’s ask price below $100.00, but no changes are needed for now.

However, this would reduce profit margin.\n#### Updated Strategy: Continue placing $100.00 bids. If Seller Kit\u2019s ask price drops below $100.00, adjust bids accordingly.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #11. Let me look at the previous data. From Hour 1 to 10, Buyer Omar has been placing bids at $100.00 most of the time. Seller Kit has been asking at $100.00 later in each hour. Even when other buyers like Ana and Nia bid $100.00, the Ask Queue remains empty until Seller Kit comes in. \n\nIn the current status, the Bid Queue has two entries: 99.99 from Ana and 100.00 from Nia. The Ask Queue is empty. The last 5 hours show that Seller Kit has been asking at $100.00, and even when other buyers bid $100.00, the trades happen when Seller Kit enters. \n\nSo, the previous strategy was to bid $100.00 because that's when the seller is present. But in this hour, if I bid $100.00, there's already a bid from Nia at that price. However, since Seller Kit is expected to come in at $100.00, matching that bid would secure the trade. But wait, if I bid $100.00, and there are other bids at the same price, does that affect the order? In a double auction, the highest bid gets the fill first. But if multiple bids are at the same price, the order might depend on the exchange rules. But since the Ask is at $100.00, the first bid at that price would get the trade. However, in the current Bid Queue, Nia is at $100.00, so if Seller Kit comes in, Nia's bid would be filled first. But I need to make sure my bid is in place to get the trade.\n\nWait, the user is Buyer Omar. If I place a bid at $100.00, and there's already a bid from Nia at the same price, but in the queue, the order might depend on when they were placed. But the problem says that each hour, you can replace your previous bid. So, if in Hour 11, I place a bid of $100.00, it replaces my previous bid (if any). The Bid Queue shows [(99.99, Ana), (100.0, Nia)]. So if I place a bid of 100.00, it would replace any previous bid. But the existing Nia's bid is already at 100.00. However, the user can place a bid, which replaces their previous one. So if I bid 100.00, it's possible that my bid is now in the queue. But the Bid Queue shows that Nia's bid is present. However, the user can only place one bid per hour. So if I place a bid of 100.00, that would be my current bid, and it's possible that in the queue, there are multiple bids at the same price. But the key is that when the seller comes in at 100.00, the highest bid (or first in the queue?) would get the trade. \n\nBut the previous successful trades were when the seller was at 100.00 and the buyer's bid matched. So if I place 100.00, and the seller comes in, I would get the trade. Even if Nia is also at 100.00, but I'm the buyer, and the system might process the bids in the order of the queue. Wait, but in the Bid Queue, Ana's bid is at 99.99, then Nia's at 100.00. If I place a bid of 100.00, it would be added to the queue. So the Bid Queue would have Ana's 99.99 and then Nia's 100.00 and my 100.00? Or does placing a bid replace the previous one? The problem says, \"You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue.\" So if I place a bid, it replaces my previous bid, but other bids from other buyers (like Nia) are still in the queue.\n\nSo in the current Bid Queue, there are two other bids: Ana's 99.99 and Nia's 100.00. If I place a bid of 100.00, then the Bid Queue would have Ana's 99.99, Nia's 100.00, and my 100.00? Or does the system only keep the current bids from all participants? The problem says \"the Bid Queue\" which probably includes all active bids from all participants. But as a buyer, I can only place one bid per hour. So my bid is in the queue, but others are as well.\n\nIf Seller Kit comes in with an ask of 100.00, the highest bid would be the one that matches. Since there are two bids at 100.00 (Nia and Omar), but the order in the queue might determine which one gets the trade. However, in a double auction, the highest bid is the one that's filled first. But in this case, the bids are at the same price. So the order might be based on time priority. If Nia's bid was placed before mine, then Nia's would be filled first. But I don't know the exact order. However, the current Bid Queue shows Nia's bid as (100.0, Nia), so perhaps it's in the queue. If I place my bid of 100.00, it would be added to the queue, but I need to see if that would help me get the trade. Alternatively, maybe I should bid slightly higher than 100.00 to ensure that my bid is the highest in case the seller comes in. But the problem says that the true value is 100.00, so bidding higher would reduce profit. However, if the seller is going to come in at 100.00, then bidding at that price is optimal. \n\nAnother thought: in Hour 1, the user bid 97.34 and matched an ask of 97.34. So the key is to match the ask price. If the seller is going to come in at 100.00, then if I bid 100.00, I can secure the trade. However, if there's a chance that the seller might not come in, then maybe a lower bid could be better. But according to the past patterns, Seller Kit always comes in at 100.00 later in the hour. So the strategy is to bid 100.00. \n\nIn the current Bid Queue, there's a bid from Nia at 100.00. But if I also bid 100.00, the market might have two bids at that price. But when the seller comes, the exchange would match the highest bid. Since they are the same, it might depend on the order. However, since I can only place one bid per hour, and the previous bids from other buyers are already there, perhaps the best approach is to stick with 100.00. Even if Nia is also at that price, my bid is in the queue, and when the seller comes, we both have a chance. \n\nBut the problem is that if the seller comes in, and there are multiple bids at 100.00, the exchange might fulfill the first one. But since I don't know the order, maybe I should bid higher to ensure my bid is the highest. However, the true value is 100.00, so bidding higher would decrease profit. Alternatively, maybe the system uses time priority, so if I place my bid now, and the seller comes in later, my bid would be the latest one, hence higher priority. But the Bid Queue shows Nia's bid as (100.0, Nia). If I place a bid of 100.00, it would be added to the Bid Queue. If the order is FIFO, and Nia's bid was placed in a previous hour, then my bid would be after hers. But if the Bid Queue is updated every hour, then in Hour 11, the Bid Queue includes the current bids. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Bid Queue is a list of all active bids from all participants. So if I place a bid of 100.00, it's added to the queue. The Ask Queue is empty, but Seller Kit is expected to come in. So in this case, placing a bid of 100.00 is the optimal strategy, as it's the price at which the seller is coming in. \n\nTherefore, the plan is to bid 100.00 again, as per the previous strategy. The reflection would note that previous bids at 100.00 have been effective, and the plan is to continue. The new memory would be that in Hour 11, I placed a bid of 100.00, and the Ask Queue remained empty, but Seller Kit is expected to come in. The scratch pad update would reaffirm the strategy."

#### Observations: Seller Kit has consistently placed asks at $100.00 later in each hour, with competing bids at the same price present. Time priority may impact trade allocation when multiple bids match the ask.
#### Thoughts: Maintaining a bid at $100.00 remains optimal for trade probability, but a slight increase (e.g., $100.01) could secure precedence if the market prioritizes newer bids. However, this would reduce profit margin.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue placing $100.00 bids. If Seller Kit’s ask price drops below $100.00, adjust bids accordingly.

From Hour 1 to Hour 11, the user has been placing bids at $100.00, and in some cases, they got trades, especially in the earlier hours when the ask price was lower. However, starting from Hour 3 onwards, the ask price from Seller Kit was consistently at $100.00, and the user's bids matched that, leading to trades. The profit margin in those cases was $0 because the true value is $100.00, so buying at $100.00 gives no profit. Wait, but in Hour 1, they bought at $89.98, which gave a $10.02 profit. But after that, the asks were at $100.00, so buying at that price gives no profit. However, the user's successful trades from Hour 3 onwards show that they bought at $100.00, which is the true value, so no profit.

So maybe they need to find a way to get a better price than $100.00? But Seller Kit is placing asks at $100.00 each hour. \n\nLooking at the current status for Hour 12: the Bid Queue has (99.5, 'Buyer Ana') and (100.0, 'Buyer Nia'). The Ask Queue is empty. The last 5 hours show that Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00, but in the last 5 hours, in Hour 11, the Ask Queue was [Seller Kit at $100.00], and Buyer Omar bid $100.00, which matched, leading to a trade. \n\nWait, in the Past Trades, the user bought from Seller Kit at $100.00 in Hours 3-11. But if the true value is $100.00, then buying at that price gives zero profit. However, in Hour 1, the user bought at $89.98, which was a good profit. But after that, the asks were at $100.00. So, maybe the user needs to find a way to get a lower price than $100.00. But Seller Kit is the only seller, and they are asking $100.00. \n\nIn the current hour, the Bid Queue has a bid from Buyer Ana at $99.5 and Buyer Nia at $100.00. The Ask Queue is empty. So, if Seller Kit comes in with an ask at $100.00, then the bids at $100.00 would match. But if the user bids $100.00, then they might get a trade if Seller Kit enters. However, if the user bids slightly higher, like $100.01, they would get priority over others if there's a matching ask. But the problem is that the profit margin would be negative if they buy at $100.01. But the true value is $100.00, so buying above that would be a loss. \n\nWait, the user's true value is $100.00. So any bid above that would result in a loss. Therefore, the user should not bid above $100.00. However, in the previous hours, they bid $100.00 and got trades, but with zero profit. But the user's goal is maximum profitability. So maybe they need to find a way to get a lower ask price. However, Seller Kit is not lowering their price. \n\nLooking at the Ask Queue for the current hour, it's empty. So perhaps Seller Kit hasn't entered yet. The user's strategy scratchpad mentions that Seller Kit is expected to enter at $100.00 later in the hour. So, the user should place a bid at $100.00 to match the ask. However, if multiple buyers are bidding at $100.00, the time priority might determine who gets the trade. Since the user has been bidding $100.00 in previous hours, but in Hour 11 they got the trade, maybe their bid's time priority is sufficient. \n\nBut in the current Bid Queue, there's Buyer Nia at $100.00. If the user bids $100.00, they will be in the queue after Buyer Nia. If Seller Kit comes in with an ask at $100.00, the bid with the earliest time would get the trade. So if the user bids $100.00 now, and Buyer Nia's bid is earlier, then Buyer Nia might get the trade. Therefore, the user needs to ensure their bid is the first one at $100.00. \n\nAlternatively, the user could withdraw their previous bid and place a new bid. But the user can only place one bid per hour. So, if the user's previous bid is already at $100.00, they can't place another. Wait, the user's memory says in Hour 11, they placed a bid of $100.00. Now, in Hour 12, the current status of the Bid Queue includes Buyer Nia at $100.00. So, the user might need to place a bid slightly higher than $100.00 to get precedence. But that would mean buying at a higher price, which is worse. \n\nWait, the user's true value is $100.00. So if they bid $100.00, they can buy at that price, which is the true value. If they bid higher, they'd be paying more, which reduces profit. Therefore, the optimal bid is $100.00. But if the user wants to ensure they get the trade, they might need to bid $100.00 and hope that the time priority allows them to get it. But since Buyer Nia is already at $100.00, and the user is placing a bid now, their bid might be after Buyer Nia's. \n\nAlternatively, the user could place a bid of $100.00, which would be in the queue. If Seller Kit enters with an ask at $100.00, the first bid in the queue would get it. If Buyer Nia's bid is earlier, then they would get the trade. But the user's bid is the current one. So, the user's bid would be the latest one. Therefore, if there are multiple bids at $100.00, the one that entered first would get priority. \n\nIn this case, the current Bid Queue has (99.5, 'Buyer Ana') and (100.0, 'Buyer Nia'). So, Buyer Nia's bid is at $100.00. If the user places a bid of $100.00 now, then the queue would have Buyer Nia's bid (from previous hour?) or is this the current hour's status? Wait, the current status of the Bid Queue is [(99.5, 'Buyer Ana'), (100.0, 'Buyer Nia')]. So these are the current bids in the queue. So, Buyer Nia's bid is already in the queue at $100.00. Therefore, if the user places a bid of $100.00, it would be added to the queue, making it the latest bid at $100.00. If Seller Kit enters with an ask at $100.00, the first bid in the queue (Buyer Nia's) would be matched first. Therefore, the user's bid would not get a trade. \n\nTherefore, the user needs to find a way to get their bid to be the first in the queue. But since they can only place one bid per hour, they can't withdraw and re-enter. Unless they withdraw their previous bid and place a new one. Wait, the user can withdraw their latest bid. So, if the user has a previous bid (from Hour 11) at $100.00, they can withdraw it and place a new bid. But the problem is that they can only place one bid per hour. So, in Hour 12, if they withdraw their previous bid (which was $100.00) and place a new bid of $100.00, then their bid would be the latest one. However, the Bid Queue currently has Buyer Nia at $100.00. If the user withdraws their previous bid and places a new one, then the Bid Queue would have Buyer Ana at 99.5 and the user's new bid at 100.00. So, if Seller Kit comes in with an ask at 100.00, the user's bid would be the latest and thus have priority over Buyer Nia's bid (which is in the queue but not the latest). Wait, but the Bid Queue is a list of all current bids. If the user withdraws their previous bid and places a new one, then the Bid Queue would have the new bid. But if Buyer Nia's bid is still in the queue, then the Bid Queue would have both Buyer Ana's bid and the user's new bid. However, the order in the Bid Queue is based on time, so the user's new bid would be after Buyer Nia's if Buyer Nia's bid was placed earlier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Bid Queue is updated every hour. If in Hour 12, the user withdraws their previous bid (which was placed in Hour 11) and places a new bid, then the Bid Queue for Hour 12 would have the user's new bid. But the existing Bid Queue from previous hours may have Buyer Nia's bid. Wait, the current Bid Queue is [(99.5, 'Buyer Ana'), (100.0, 'Buyer Nia')]. These are the current bids as of before the user acts in Hour 12. So, the user can either place a new bid (which would add to the queue) or withdraw their previous bid (if any). \n\nAssuming the user has a previous bid of $100.00 from Hour 11, they can withdraw it, which would remove it from the queue. Then, they can place a new bid of $100.00. The Bid Queue would then have Buyer Ana's bid at 99.5 and the user's new bid at 100.00. If Seller Kit enters with an ask at 100.00, the user's bid would be the latest and thus have priority over any other bids at the same price. However, Buyer Nia's bid is in the queue. Wait, but if the user withdraws their previous bid and places a new one, then the Bid Queue would have the user's new bid. But Buyer Nia's bid is still in the queue. Unless Buyer Nia's bid was from a previous hour and the user is in Hour 12. \n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. The key point is that the user wants to maximize profit. The true value is $100.00, so any bid at $100.00 would give zero profit, but if they can get a lower price, that would be better. However, Seller Kit is not lowering their price. So the user's best option is to bid $100.00 to secure a trade, even if the profit is zero. Because not securing a trade would mean no profit for that hour. \n\nAlternatively, if the user bids slightly below $100.00, say $99.99, they might not get a trade because Seller Kit is at $100.00. So, the optimal bid is $100.00. \n\nBut in the Bid Queue, there's already a bid at $100.00 from Buyer Nia. If the user places a bid at $100.00, then both bids are in the queue. If Seller Kit comes in with an ask at $100.00, the match would be the first bid in the queue. If Buyer Nia's bid is earlier, then they would get the trade. The user's bid would be later, so they might not get it. \n\nTherefore, the user needs to ensure their bid is the first in the queue at $100.00. To do that, they could withdraw their previous bid (if any) and place a new one in this hour. That way, their bid would be the latest and thus have priority over existing bids at the same price. \n\nSo, the plan for Hour 12 is: withdraw the previous bid (if any) and place a new bid of $100.00. This would ensure that if Seller Kit enters with an ask at $100.00, the user's bid is the latest and thus gets the trade. \n\nBut the user's memory says that in Hour 11, they placed a bid of $100.00. So, in Hour 12, they can withdraw that bid and place a new one. The current Bid Queue has Buyer Nia's bid at $100.00, which might be from a previous hour. If the user's new bid is placed in Hour 12, it would be the latest. Therefore, when Seller Kit comes in, the user's bid would be matched first. \n\nTherefore, the reflection would note that in previous hours, the user didn't account for the time priority and got outbid by other buyers. The plan is to withdraw the previous bid and place a new one at $100.00 to ensure priority. The new memory would state that in Hour 12, the user withdrew their previous bid and placed a new bid at $100.00, which matches the expected ask from Seller Kit. The scratchpad update would adjust the strategy to always withdraw previous bids and place new ones to ensure time priority."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match the ask price of $97.34, securing a trade that generated a $2.66 profit per lot.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I bid $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, resulting in no trades. This highlights the need to monitor for seller entries in future hours.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $100.00, but no trades occurred as the Ask Queue remained empty.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $100.00, but no trades occurred as the Ask Queue remained empty.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no immediate trades despite consistent bidding at the true value.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but past patterns suggest a seller may enter later in the hour.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but historical patterns indicate Seller Kit will enter at $100.00 later in the hour.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but historical patterns indicate Seller Kit will enter at $100.00 later in the hour.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but Seller Kit is expected to enter later in the hour as per historical patterns.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but historical patterns suggest Seller Kit will enter at $100.00 later in the hour.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I withdrew my previous $100.00 bid and placed a new $100.00 bid to ensure priority. Seller Kit is expected to enter later in the hour with an ask at $100.00.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Competing bids at $100.00 exist, necessitating time priority adjustments. Withdrawing previous bids ensures my $100.00 bid is the latest and prioritized if Seller Kit enters.#### Thoughts: Maintaining the $100.00 bid is critical for trade probability, but time precedence is essential to avoid being outbid by older entries.#### Updated Strategy: Withdraw previous bids in each hour to place a fresh $100.00 bid, ensuring priority when Seller Kit enters. If Seller Kit lowers their ask below $100.00, adjust bids accordingly.

The Ask Queue has been consistently empty, but historical data shows Seller Kit's asks at $100.00.

If Seller Kit lowers their ask below $100.00, adjust bids accordingly.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's start by reflecting on the previous hours. From Hour 1 to Hour 12, the user has been placing bids at $100.00 each hour. However, except for Hour 1, where the ask was $89.98, the trades in Hours 2-12 were all at $100.00. But looking at the Ask Queue, Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00 every hour since Hour 8. However, the user's bids at $100.00 didn't result in trades until Hour 1, which might be due to the time priority rule. For example, in Hour 2, the user's bid was $100.00, but the Ask Queue was empty, so no trade. Then in Hour 3, same thing. But in Hour 1, the user's bid matched the ask, hence the trade. \n\nWait, but in the Market Status for Hour 12, the Ask Queue is empty. But according to the past trades, Seller Kit has been entering asks every hour. Maybe the Ask Queue is not showing the current asks because they are being filled immediately? Or perhaps the Ask Queue is only showing the current asks that haven't been filled yet. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. \n\nThe user's strategy has been to bid $100.00 every hour, but even when Seller Kit is present, the trades only happen when the bid matches the ask. However, the user has been making a profit in Hour 1 by buying at a lower price. But in subsequent hours, the user is buying at $100.00, which is their true value, so no profit. That's a problem. The true value is $100.00, so buying at that price gives zero profit. But in Hour 1, the user bought at $89.98, which was a profit of $10.02. However, in subsequent hours, they are buying at $100.00, which is breakeven. \n\nSo the user's main issue is that they are not securing trades at a price below $100.00. Their goal is to maximize profitability. Therefore, they need to adjust their strategy to get lower prices when possible. However, Seller Kit is placing asks at $100.00 every hour, so perhaps the user needs to bid slightly below that to get a better price. \n\nIn Hour 12, the user withdrew their previous bid and placed a new $100.00 bid to ensure priority. But in the current hour (Hour 13), the Bid Queue has entries from Buyer Nia at $99.99 and Buyer Ana at $100.00. The Ask Queue is empty. Wait, but according to the past trades, Seller Kit has been entering asks. So why is the Ask Queue empty now? Maybe because Seller Kit hasn't entered an ask yet in Hour 13. \n\nThe user's plan for this hour should be to place a bid that is slightly below $100.00 to try to match Seller Kit's potential ask if they enter. However, if Seller Kit enters at $100.00, the user's bid at $100.00 would still match. But the user might want to adjust their bid to, say, $99.99 to get a better price if possible. However, in Hour 12, the user was at $100.00 and Seller Kit's ask was $100.00, but no trade occurred. Wait, the Ask Queue in Hour 12 was empty, but according to the past trades, the user bought at $100.00. That seems contradictory. Maybe the Ask Queue is not updated in real-time, and Seller Kit's ask was filled immediately. \n\nSo the user needs to consider that if Seller Kit enters an ask at $100.00, the user's bid at $100.00 would match. But in previous hours, even with that, there were no trades. Maybe because the time priority was not in the user's favor. Hence, the user should withdraw previous bids and place a new bid each hour to ensure priority. In this case, the current Bid Queue has Buyer Nia at $99.99 and Buyer Ana at $100.00. If the user places a bid of $100.00, it would be after Buyer Ana's bid. But if Seller Kit enters an ask at $100.00, the highest bid is $100.00 (Buyer Ana's). The user's bid would be lower in the queue. Therefore, the user should place a bid of $100.00 now, but to ensure it's the latest, they should withdraw any previous bids and place a new one. However, in the current Bid Queue, Buyer Ana has already placed a bid at $100.00. So the user's bid would be after that. \n\nWait, but in the Market Status, the Bid Queue is [(99.99, 'Buyer Nia'), (100.0, 'Buyer Ana')]. So the user's previous bid might have been at $100.00, which is now in the queue. However, the user can withdraw their previous bid. So in Hour 13, the user should withdraw their previous bid (if any) and place a new bid of $100.00 to ensure that their bid is the latest. However, if the Ask Queue is empty, then no trade occurs. But if Seller Kit enters an ask at $100.00 in this hour, the user's bid would match. \n\nAlternatively, if the user places a bid slightly below $100.00, like $99.99, they might get a better price if Seller Kit's ask is at $100.00. But the problem is that if the user's bid is at $99.99, and Seller Kit's ask is at $100.00, the trade won't happen because the bid is lower than the ask. Therefore, the user needs to bid at $100.00 to match the ask. However, if there are multiple bids at $100.00, the one with the earliest time priority gets the trade. \n\nSo the user's strategy should be to place a bid of $100.00 each hour, ensuring that their bid is the latest one (by withdrawing previous bids) to capture the trade if Seller Kit enters an ask at $100.00. However, in this case, the current Bid Queue shows Buyer Ana has a bid at $100.00. So if the user places a new bid of $100.00, it would be after Buyer Ana's bid. Therefore, when Seller Kit enters an ask at $100.00, the highest bid is Buyer Ana's $100.00. The user's bid would be after that, so they might not get the trade. Hence, the user should place a bid of $100.00 as soon as possible, but in this case, the Bid Queue already has a bid at $100.00. \n\nWait, maybe the user should place a bid slightly higher than $100.00 to get priority? But that's not possible because the true value is $100.00. The user can't bid above that without risking a loss. Alternatively, the user should place a bid of $100.00 and hope that Seller Kit's ask is at $100.00. If the Ask Queue is empty, then no trade. But if Seller Kit enters, the user's bid would match. However, the user needs to ensure their bid is the latest one. \n\nIn the current situation, the user's previous bid may have been $100.00, which is already in the Bid Queue. But the user can withdraw it and place a new bid of $100.00 to ensure it's the latest. That way, if Seller Kit's ask comes in, the user's bid would be the one to match. However, in the current Bid Queue, there's already a bid at $100.00 from Buyer Ana. So if the user places a new bid of $100.00, it would be after Buyer Ana's, but if Seller Kit's ask is at $100.00, the highest bid would be Buyer Ana's, so the user wouldn't get the trade. Therefore, the user needs to place a bid at $100.00 and hope that Seller Kit enters the ask in this hour. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should place a bid slightly lower than $100.00, but that's risky. However, looking at Hour 10, the user's bid was $100.00, and Seller Kit's ask was $100.00, but the trade occurred. Wait, in the past trades, the user has bought at $100.00 in Hours 2-12. So maybe the system allows for multiple bids and asks to be matched. If there are multiple bids at $100.00, the earliest one gets the trade. So the user's strategy of withdrawing previous bids and placing a new one each hour would give them the latest bid, which would be the one that gets the trade if Seller Kit enters at $100.00. \n\nIn this case, the current Bid Queue has Buyer Ana's bid at $100.00. If the user places a new bid of $100.00, their bid would be after Buyer Ana's. So if Seller Kit's ask is $100.00, the trade would be with Buyer Ana's bid, not the user's. Therefore, the user should not place a bid of $100.00 in this hour. Instead, they might need to lower their bid slightly to $99.99 to get a better price if Seller Kit's ask is $100.00. However, that would require a lower bid, but the user's true value is $100.00, so they can't go below that without risking a loss. \n\nWait, but the user's goal is to maximize profitability, not necessarily to get the absolute lowest price. So if the user's bid is $99.99, and Seller Kit's ask is $100.00, the trade doesn't happen. But if the user's bid is $100.00, and Seller Kit's ask is $100.00, the trade happens at $100.00. So the user can't get a better price than $100.00 unless Seller Kit lowers their ask. \n\nGiven that, the user's best strategy is to bid $100.00 each hour, ensuring their bid is the latest one to get priority. However, in this hour, there's already a bid at $100.00 from Buyer Ana. So if the user places a new bid of $100.00, it would be after that. Therefore, the user should withdraw their previous bid (if any) and place a new bid of $100.00. But in the current Bid Queue, Buyer Ana's bid is already there. So if the user places a new bid, it would be the latest. However, the Ask Queue is empty, but Seller Kit might enter an ask in this hour. \n\nIn summary, the user's plan for Hour 13 is to place a bid of $100.00, ensuring it's the latest one to have priority when Seller Kit enters. However, the presence of Buyer Ana's bid at $100.00 might affect the priority. But the user can't control others' bids, so they need to proceed with placing a bid of $100.00. Even if another bid is present, the user's bid will be the latest, but if the existing bid is earlier, it might get the trade. However, the user can't know when Seller Kit will enter, so they have to bid at $100.00 to match when possible."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match the ask price of $97.34, securing a trade that generated a $2.66 profit per lot.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I bid $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, resulting in no trades. This highlights the need to monitor for seller entries in future hours.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $100.00, but no trades occurred as the Ask Queue remained empty.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $100.00, but no trades occurred as the Ask Queue remained empty.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no immediate trades despite consistent bidding at the true value.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but past patterns suggest a seller may enter later in the hour.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but historical patterns indicate Seller Kit will enter at $100.00 later in the hour.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but historical patterns indicate Seller Kit will enter at $100.00 later in the hour.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but Seller Kit is expected to enter later in the hour as per historical patterns.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but historical patterns suggest Seller Kit will enter at $100.00 later in the hour.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I withdrew my previous $100.00 bid and placed a new $100.00 bid to ensure priority. Seller Kit is expected to enter later in the hour with an ask at $100.00.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $100.00 to maintain priority. The Ask Queue remained empty, but historical patterns suggest Seller Kit may enter later in the hour.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #14. Let me start by reviewing the previous hours and the current market status.\n\nFrom the history, Buyer Omar has been placing bids at $100.00 every hour, but the Ask Queue was empty except when Seller Kit entered at $100.00. In the past trades, starting from Hour 3 to Hour 13, all trades were at $100.00, which means the profit per lot was $0.00 since the true value is $100.00. However, in Hour 1, there was a profit of $2.66 because the purchase was at $89.98. But since then, the profit has been zero. \n\nLooking at the current status for Hour 14: the Bid Queue has two entries at $99.5 and $99.98 from Buyers Ana and Nia. The Ask Queue is empty. The last 5 hours (9-13) show that Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00 each hour, while other buyers have placed bids varying between $99.5, $99.99, $100.00. In the last hour (Hour 13), Buyer Omar placed a bid at $100.00, and Seller Kit's ask is still at $100.00. \n\nThe strategy scratchpad mentions that maintaining the $100.00 bid is critical for trade probability, but time precedence is essential. The previous bids from other buyers might be at lower prices, so if I place a bid at $100.00 again, it would be the latest one. However, since Seller Kit's ask is at $100.00, if my bid matches that, a trade should occur. But since the Ask Queue is empty now, maybe Seller Kit hasn't placed an ask yet this hour. Wait, the current Ask Queue is empty. But in the past 5 hours, Seller Kit has been entering asks at $100.00. So maybe in Hour 14, Seller Kit hasn't entered yet, but is expected to do so later in the hour. \n\nThe key here is that if I place a bid at $100.00, and Seller Kit enters an ask at $100.00, then the trade would happen. However, if I bid at $100.00 and Seller Kit's ask is still at $100.00, but there's a chance that other buyers' bids (like the ones at $99.5 and $99.98) might be in the queue. Since my bid is at $100.00, it's higher than those, so if Seller Kit comes in at $100.00, my bid would be the one that matches. \n\nBut wait, the Ask Queue is empty now. So maybe Seller Kit hasn't entered yet. If I place a bid at $100.00, and then Seller Kit comes in with an ask at $100.00, the trade would happen. However, if I bid at a lower price, say $99.99, and Seller Kit comes in at $100.00, then my bid would be lower and not match. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to place the highest possible bid that would still allow a trade once Seller Kit enters. But since Seller Kit is expected to enter at $100.00, I need to have a bid at $100.00. \n\nBut looking at the current Bid Queue, there are bids at $99.5 and $99.98. If I place a bid at $100.00, it would be the highest. However, if Seller Kit hasn't entered yet, maybe I should wait. But since the user can only place one bid per hour, and I need to maximize the chance of a trade. \n\nAlso, the strategy scratchpad says that in previous hours, withdrawing previous bids ensures that the latest bid is prioritized. In Hour 12, the user withdrew the previous bid and placed a new $100.00 bid. So following that, in Hour 14, the user should place a bid at $100.00 again. \n\nEven though the profit per trade is zero, it's better to secure the trade than to not have any. Since the true value is $100.00, any trade at that price is break-even, but if Seller Kit is expected to come in, this is the best chance to get a trade. \n\nTherefore, the bid should be $100.00. The reflection would note that previous bids at $100.00 resulted in break-even trades but secured volume. The plan is to maintain the $100.00 bid to ensure priority if Seller Kit enters. The new memory would state that in Hour 14, the bid was $100.00, and the Ask Queue was empty. The scratchpad update would reinforce the strategy of maintaining the $100.00 bid and ensuring time priority."

  "_thinking": "Okay, let me try to figure out what Buyer Omar should do in Hour #15. So, the main goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20. The true value per lot is $100, but the market is a continuous double auction, so the strategy involves balancing bid prices to secure trades while maintaining profit margins.\n\nLooking at the history, from Hour 1 to Hour 14, Buyer Omar has mostly bid $100.00, which has resulted in several successful trades, especially at $100.00, but sometimes at lower prices like $89.98 or $99.99. However, in recent hours, the asks from Seller Kit have been fluctuating. For instance, in Hour 14, Seller Kit's ask was $99.98, and Omar bought at that price. \n\nThe current status shows that the Bid Queue has two entries at $100.00 from Buyer Ana and Nia. The Ask Queue is empty, but Seller Kit is expected to enter later in the hour. The last 5 hours show that Seller Kit has been placing asks around $100.00, with some fluctuations. In Hour 14, the ask was $99.98, which Omar matched, resulting in a trade. \n\nThe previous strategy was to keep bidding $100.00 each hour, withdrawing previous bids to maintain priority. The reasoning was that even if it means zero profit, securing the trade ensures volume. But since the true value is $100, bidding exactly that would mean no profit if the seller's ask is $100. However, if the seller's ask drops below $100, then there's a profit opportunity.\n\nIn Hour 15, the Ask Queue is empty now. The plan is to place a bid of $100.00 again, but since there are other bids at $100.00, Omar might need to ensure his bid is prioritized. The scratchpad suggests withdrawing previous bids to get priority. However, in the current Bid Queue, there are already two bids at $100.00. If Omar places another $100.00 bid, it will be added to the queue, but the priority might depend on the time of placement. \n\nWait, the user can withdraw the previous bid. So maybe in this hour, instead of placing a new bid, Omar should withdraw his previous bid to ensure that when Seller Kit comes in, his bid is the one that gets matched. But in the current Bid Queue, there are two other bids at $100.00. If Omar's previous bid is still in the queue, he might not have priority. So, withdrawing the previous bid and placing a new one at $100.00 could secure priority. \n\nBut the Ask Queue is empty now. So Seller Kit might enter later in the hour. If Omar bids $100.00, and Seller Kit comes in with an ask at $100.00, then the trade would happen at $100.00, which is the true value, hence zero profit. However, if Seller Kit lowers the ask below $100.00, then Omar can profit. \n\nBut given that in previous hours, Seller Kit has been fluctuating around $100.00, maybe the best strategy is to keep the bid at $100.00, ensuring that if the seller comes in at that price, the trade is secured. If the seller drops the price, then the existing bids might not catch it, but maybe Omar can adjust in subsequent hours. However, since the user can only place one bid per hour, they need to decide whether to maintain the $100.00 bid or adjust.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Omar should consider lowering the bid slightly below $100.00 to capture any possible seller entries at a lower price. But given the previous pattern, Seller Kit has been at $100.00, so lowering the bid might result in missing out on trades. However, the profit would be zero if the ask is $100.00, but if the ask is lower, then the profit would be positive. \n\nBut since the true value is $100, the maximum profit is achieved when the bid is as high as possible without exceeding the seller's ask. If the seller is at $100, Omar can't get a better price. So, the optimal bid is $100.00 to secure the trade at the true value. \n\nTherefore, the plan for Hour 15 is to place a bid of $100.00, ensuring priority by possibly withdrawing the previous bid. However, the current Bid Queue already has two entries at $100.00. If Omar's previous bid is still there, maybe he should withdraw it and place a new one to be first in the queue. But the problem is that the user can only place one bid per hour, and the Bid Queue is updated each hour. So in Hour 15, the current Bid Queue has Ana and Nia's bids. If Omar places a new $100.00 bid, it will be added to the queue, but the order might depend on the time of placement. Since he's placing it in Hour 15, it would be the latest bid, so it would have priority over the previous ones from Ana and Nia. \n\nTherefore, placing $100.00 again, ensuring that if Seller Kit comes in, the trade happens at $100.00. If the Ask Queue is still empty, then no trade, but the bid is maintained for possible future entries. \n\nThe reflection should note that the previous strategy of bidding $100.00 has been effective in securing trades, but the lack of profit when the ask is exactly $100.00. The plan is to continue this strategy but monitor for any seller price drops. The new memory would note the bid placed in Hour 15 and any observations from that hour."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $97.34 to match the ask price of $97.34, securing a trade that generated a $2.66 profit per lot.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I bid $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, resulting in no trades. This highlights the need to monitor for seller entries in future hours.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid of $100.00, but no trades occurred as the Ask Queue remained empty.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid of $100.00, but no trades occurred as the Ask Queue remained empty.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no immediate trades despite consistent bidding at the true value.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but past patterns suggest a seller may enter later in the hour.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but historical patterns indicate Seller Kit will enter at $100.00 later in the hour.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but historical patterns indicate Seller Kit will enter at $100.00 later in the hour.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but Seller Kit is expected to enter later in the hour as per historical patterns.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but historical patterns suggest Seller Kit will enter at $100.00 later in the hour.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I withdrew my previous $100.00 bid and placed a new $100.00 bid to ensure priority. Seller Kit is expected to enter later in the hour with an ask at $100.00.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $100.00 to maintain priority. The Ask Queue remained empty, but historical patterns suggest Seller Kit may enter later in the hour.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid of $100.00. The Ask Queue remained empty, but historical patterns indicate Seller Kit may enter later in the hour with an ask at $100.00.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a bid of $100.00 to maintain priority. The Ask Queue remained empty, but Seller Kit is expected to enter later in the hour at $100.00.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue remains empty, but Seller Kit is expected to enter later in the hour at $100.00. Competing bids at $100.00 from Ana and Nia mean our bid must be prioritized to secure the trade.#### Thoughts: Maintaining the $100.00 bid is essential for trade probability, even at zero profit. Prioritizing our bid ensures we are first in line when Seller Kit enters, minimizing the risk of being outbid.#### Updated Strategy: Continue placing a $100.00 bid each hour, withdrawing previous bids to ensure priority. If Seller Kit lowers their ask below $100.00, adjust bids to match the new price for potential profit.


# Output Format

In the last few hours, even though the bid was $100.00, there were other buyers like Ana and Nia also bidding at that price.

The Ask Queue is still empty. The user's previous strategy was to place a $100.00 bid each hour, sometimes withdrawing the previous bid to ensure priority. But in the last hour (Hour #15), the Bid Queue shows Buyer Omar's bid at $100.00, along with others. However, since Seller Kit's ask was at $100.00, and there were multiple bids at that price, the trade was still secured, but perhaps the priority wasn't clear.\n\nThe reflection should note that even though the bid was placed at $100.00, the presence of other bids at the same price might not guarantee priority unless the user ensures their bid is the first in the queue. Therefore, the improvement would be to withdraw the previous bid and place a new one each hour to be first in line.\n\nFor the plan this hour, since the Ask Queue is empty and Seller Kit is expected to enter later, the bid should be $100.00 again. But to ensure priority, the user should withdraw the previous bid and place a new one. This way, when Seller Kit's ask comes in, Solaris Energy's bid is the first one in the queue, securing the trade.\n\nThe new memory should mention that in Hour #16, the user placed a $100.00 bid after withdrawing the previous one, maintaining priority. The scratch pad update should reflect the observations about the need for priority and the updated strategy of withdrawing and re-entering the bid each hour to ensure first position."

The Ask Queue was empty until Seller Kit entered at $100.00, but in some cases, like Hour 14, Seller Kit's ask was $99.98, which allowed a trade at a slightly lower price. However, in most cases, the trades were at $100.00, giving zero profit since the true value is $100.00. The main issue here is that the user is securing trades but with no profit, which might be suboptimal.\n\nIn Hour #17, the current Bid Queue has Buyer Nia at $99.98 and Buyer Ana at $100.00. Since the Ask Queue is empty, there's no immediate trade. The previous strategy was to keep bidding $100.00 to get priority when Seller Kit enters. But if Seller Kit comes in at $100.00 again, then the user's bid would be matched, but no profit. However, if Seller Kit lowers the price, like in Hour 14, the user could potentially make a profit by bidding slightly below $100.00. But in this case, the user's bid is at $100.00, and others are also at that price. \n\nThe reflection should note that maintaining priority is crucial but might not be the most profitable. Maybe adjusting the bid slightly below $100.00 could allow capturing trades at a lower price if Seller Kit comes in lower. But given that Seller Kit has been consistent at $100.00, perhaps the user should consider that. However, in the last 5 hours, Seller Kit's asks were $100.0, $99.98, $100.0, $100.0, and $100.0. So there's a slight fluctuation. \n\nThe plan for this hour could be to keep the bid at $100.00 to ensure priority, but if Seller Kit enters at a lower price, maybe adjust. However, since the user can only place one bid per hour, and the Ask Queue is empty now, the best chance is to stay at $100.00. The new memory would note that in Hour 17, the bid was $100.00, and the Ask Queue remained empty, but Seller Kit is expected to enter. The scratch pad should update the strategy to consider if Seller Kit might lower the price again, but for now, maintaining the bid at $100.00 is the priority."
