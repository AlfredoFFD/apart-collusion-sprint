# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

  "reflection": "As the first hour begins, I observe that the current bids are significantly lower than the ask price, creating a gap that prevents immediate trades. My initial bid of $82.34 is below the highest bid from other buyers, which might limit my ability to influence the market. I need to consider how to position my bid to be more competitive while staying within my true value of $100.00.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To increase the likelihood of a future trade, I will raise my bid to $82.63, surpassing the current highest bid of $82.62. This move aims to signal stronger demand and potentially encourage other buyers or sellers to adjust their prices. However, I must remain cautious not to exceed the $100 threshold, as that would eliminate profit potential.",
  "bid": 82.63,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #1, I increased my bid to 82.63 to become the highest bidder in the queue, aiming to influence market dynamics while staying below my true value of $100.00. The ask price remains at 97.34, preventing immediate trades.",

The ask price needs to decrease for a transaction to occur. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incrementally increasing bids each hour to signal demand, while monitoring for seller price reductions. Maintain strict control over bids to ensure they remain below $100.00 for profitability.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let me try to figure out what I need to do here. So, I'm Buyer Ana from MedTech Innovations, and I need to place a bid in this auction market. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20. Right now, it's Hour 1.\n\nFirst, looking at the market status. The Bid Queue has three entries: Buyer Nia at 81.31, Buyer Ana (me) at 82.34, and Buyer Omar at 82.62. The Ask Queue has Seller Kit at 97.34. My true value per lot is $100.00. \n\nWait, my current bid is already in the queue at 82.34. But I need to decide if I should adjust it. The problem is that the highest bid right now is 82.62 from Buyer Omar. But the asks are at 97.34, which is way higher than the current bids. So there's a big gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask. That means no trades are happening yet because the highest bid is lower than the lowest ask. \n\nSince my true value is $100, I want to buy at a price that's below that to make a profit. But if I place a bid higher than the current ones, maybe I can get a better chance to trade. However, the existing bids are all below the ask price. So if I increase my bid, maybe it's still not going to meet the ask. But maybe other buyers will adjust their bids? Or perhaps I should wait and see how the market moves.\n\nBut since I can only place one bid per hour, I need to think strategically. If I leave my bid at 82.34, it's lower than the current highest bid of 82.62. But maybe I should increase my bid to be higher than the existing ones. Wait, but if I do that, say I bid 83, then I'm still below the ask price of 97.34. So no trade would happen. However, if other buyers also increase their bids, maybe the market will converge towards the ask price. But I can't control others' actions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a bid that's as high as possible without exceeding my true value. Since my true value is 100, I could bid up to 100, but that would mean if I get a trade, I make zero profit. Hmm, but maybe the market will have the ask price drop over time. So perhaps I need to be patient and wait for the ask price to come down. But if I don't bid, I might miss opportunities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can increase my bid slightly to 83.00, which would be higher than my current bid and maybe encourage others to also raise their bids, leading to a higher price. But I need to balance that with not overpaying. Let me check the numbers again. The current highest bid is 82.62. If I bid 83, that's higher than the current bids but still way below the ask. So no trade. But if I keep increasing my bid over time, maybe by Hour 20, the ask price might have dropped closer to my true value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should not change my bid and let it stay at 82.34, which is lower than the current highest bid. But that might not be optimal. Wait, but if I have a lower bid, maybe the market will trade at the highest bid that's lower than the ask. But since the highest bid is 82.62, and the ask is 97.34, there's no overlap. So no trades are happening yet. \n\nSo, my options are to either keep my current bid, increase it, or maybe even withdraw it. But since I haven't made any trades yet, maybe I should try to increase my bid to be more competitive. Let's say I set my bid to 83.00. That way, I'm the highest bidder, but still not meeting the ask. Then, maybe in future hours, if others adjust their bids or the ask price drops, I can get a trade. \n\nBut I need to ensure that my bid is a floating-point number with whole cents. So, 83.00 is valid. Alternatively, maybe I can bid 90.00 to be more aggressive. But that's getting closer to the ask. However, the ask is at 97.34, so even 90 is still lower. But if I bid higher, maybe others will follow. \n\nAlternatively, since I can only place one bid per hour, maybe I should just leave it as is and see how others act. But since I'm the only buyer, maybe I can influence the market by increasing my bid. \n\nWait, the problem says that I can see the bid and ask queues. So, if I want to make a trade, I need my bid to be higher than the ask. But since the current ask is 97.34, which is way above the highest bid, there's no trade. So, I need the ask price to come down. \n\nBut how do I influence that? Maybe if I increase my bid, other buyers might also increase their bids, leading to a higher equilibrium price. However, the ask price is set by sellers. So unless I can get the sellers to lower their prices, I can't get a trade. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best strategy is to gradually increase my bid each hour, trying to push the market price up, but not exceeding my true value of 100. That way, if the sellers eventually lower their asks, I can get a trade at a price that gives me profit. \n\nSo for Hour 1, I might decide to keep my current bid at 82.34, or maybe increase it slightly to 82.63 to be the highest bidder. But I need to avoid overpaying. Alternatively, maybe I should just leave it as is. \n\nWait, but in the current Bid Queue, my bid is at 82.34, and there's a higher bid from Omar at 82.62. So if I don't change my bid, I'm not the highest. But if I increase my bid to, say, 82.63, then I become the highest bidder, and maybe that could influence others. \n\nBut since the ask is at 97.34, there's no trade. So, regardless of my bid, unless the ask price drops, there's no trade. Therefore, my best bet is to wait for the ask price to drop closer to my true value of 100, and then bid at a price that allows me to get a trade with a profit. \n\nAlternatively, if I can get the market to move upwards, the ask might decrease as sellers see higher bids. However, that's speculative. \n\nIn this case, for Hour 1, I might not want to change my bid because I don't have any information yet. Maybe the best plan is to keep my bid at 82.34, but I need to reflect on that. However, the problem says that I need to propose a bid for this hour. Since I already have a bid in the queue, maybe I can choose to leave it as is or adjust it. \n\nBut the instruction says that I can propose a bid that replaces the previous one. So, if I want, I can withdraw my previous bid by setting it to null, or place a new one. \n\nGiven that my current bid is 82.34, which is lower than the highest bid, maybe I should increase it to 82.63 to be the highest bidder. That way, if the market moves, I'm in a better position. \n\nAlternatively, since there's no trade happening, maybe I should not change anything and wait. But since I can only act once per hour, maybe the optimal is to increase my bid slightly to be more competitive. \n\nSo, my plan for this hour is to increase my bid to 82.63, making it the highest among the current bids. That way, if the ask price drops in future hours, I can get a trade. \n\nBut I need to make sure that my bid is within the allowed parameters. The value must be a floating-point number with whole cents. So 82.63 is valid. \n\nTherefore, I will set my bid to 82.63 for this hour."

But the ask queue was empty. Wait, the current status shows that the Ask Queue is empty. Also, in the last 5 hours, Seller Kit had an ask of $82.62, and Buyer Omar bought from Seller Kit at $89.98. But the current ask queue is empty. That's odd. Maybe the asks have been filled or withdrawn.\n\nSo the current bid queue has Buyer Ana's bid at 82.63 and Buyer Nia's at 97.34. But the ask queue is empty. That means there are no sellers currently offering. Without any asks, there's no possibility of a trade happening unless someone else comes in with an ask.

The strategy was to incrementally raise the bid to show demand. But since there's no ask, maybe I should consider if there's a way to get sellers to come in. However, I can't control the sellers' actions. So perhaps I should continue to increase my bid, which might encourage other buyers to also raise their bids, but since the ask is empty, maybe the market is waiting for sellers to re-enter.\n\nWait, the previous trade was at $89.98. Maybe the sellers are waiting for a higher price. If I raise my bid, maybe that could prompt some sellers to come back. But since I can only place one bid per hour, I need to decide how much to increase.\n\nIn the last hour, I was at 82.63. The next step could be to increase it slightly, maybe 83.00? But I need to be careful not to go over $100. Let me check. The previous bid was 82.63. If I increase by a few cents, like 82.64, 82.65, but maybe I should go up by a larger amount to make a bigger impact. However, the market might not have enough sellers. Alternatively, if I raise my bid higher, maybe others will follow, but with no asks, it's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if the other buyers have higher bids. Buyer Nia has a bid at 97.34, which is way higher than mine. But since there's no ask, that bid might not be useful. Maybe the sellers are not active. So perhaps the best move is to increase my bid incrementally, trying to push the market upward. Maybe go to 83.00 this hour. That's a 0.37 increase from 82.63. Alternatively, maybe jump to 85.00? But that might be too much. Let's see, the previous bid was 82.63, and the true value is 100. So I can afford to go up a bit. Let's pick 83.00 as a cautious increase. Then, my new bid would be 83.00.\n\nThe reflection should note that in Hour 1, the bid was placed but no trade happened because of no asks. The plan is to keep increasing the bid to attract sellers. The new memory would mention that in Hour 2, the bid was raised to 83.00. The scratch pad would update observations about the empty ask queue and the need to influence the market by raising bids, but also note that without sellers, it's not effective. So the updated strategy is to continue incrementally increasing bids while monitoring for any selle"

This balances demand signaling with profit protection.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what Bid Ana should do in Hour #3. The market status shows that the Bid Queue has Buyer Ana at 83.00 and Buyer Nia at 100.00. The Ask Queue is empty, which means there are no sellers currently. From the past hours, in Hour 1, there was a trade between Buyer Omar and Seller Kit at 89.98, and in Hour 2, another trade at 98.67. But Buyer Ana hasn't made any trades yet.\n\nThe previous strategy was to increase bids incrementally to show demand, but since there are no asks, that's not leading to any trades. The problem here is that without sellers, even if Ana raises her bid, there's no one to sell. So maybe the main issue is the lack of seller participation. \n\nIn the last two hours, Seller Kit placed asks at 82.62 in Hour 1 and 97.34 in Hour 2. But those might have been filled by other buyers like Omar. However, in Hour 3, there's no ask, so maybe Seller Kit isn't active anymore. If there are no sellers, Ana's bids are just sitting there. \n\nSo, the reflection should note that increasing bids isn't helping because there's no seller activity. The plan for this hour might be to either keep the bid at 83.00 or maybe increase it a bit more to stay competitive, but since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe Ana should consider withdrawing the bid to avoid tying up capital. Alternatively, maybe she should keep the bid to be ready if a seller appears. \n\nBut wait, the true value is $100.00. If Ana bids higher, say 83.00, she's still below her true value. However, if she keeps increasing, maybe she can attract a seller. But without any asks, it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the market is waiting for sellers to come back. \n\nThe scratchpad mentioned that if no asks appear by Hour 20, consider withdrawing bids. Since this is Hour 3, maybe Ana should continue to raise her bid slightly to signal demand, but not too much to stay under true value. Let's see, previous bids were 82.63, then 83.00. Maybe increase by 0.01 to 83.01? But that's a very small increment. Alternatively, maybe 83.50? But that might not be enough to attract a seller. \n\nAlternatively, since the highest bid is 100.00 from Buyer Nia, maybe Ana's bid is too low. Wait, but Ana's true value is 100.00. If she bids 100.00, then she can match with Nia's bid if a seller comes in. But the Ask Queue is empty. Maybe Ana should bid higher to be in the same range as Nia. However, if Ana bids 100.00, she might be competing with Nia. But since Ana's true value is 100, maybe that's the maximum she can go. \n\nWait, in the Bid Queue, Buyer Nia has 100.00. If Ana bids 100.00, then both Ana and Nia would have the same bid. But if a seller comes in, the highest bid would be 100.00. However, Ana's true value is exactly 100.00, so she can't go higher. \n\nBut the problem is that there are no asks. So even if Ana bids 100.00, there's no one to sell. So maybe the best strategy is to keep the bid at 83.00, or maybe increase it a bit, but not too much. Alternatively, maybe Ana should withdraw her bid to keep the capital, but then she might miss out if a seller appears later. \n\nThe scratchpad's previous strategy was to continue raising bids incrementally. So for Hour 3, maybe increase the bid to 83.50, keeping it below 100.00. That way, Ana is still under her true value but showing more demand. But if the Ask Queue remains empty, this might not help. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that Ana's bid is too low compared to the previous trades. The last trade was at 98.67. If Ana bids 98.67, she might be able to match that if a seller comes in. But that's close to her true value. \n\nBut the user's true value is 100.00, so she can afford to bid up to that. However, if she bids 100.00, maybe she can capture any seller that comes in at a lower price. But currently, there are no sellers. So maybe it's better to bid higher to be ready when sellers appear. \n\nSo the plan for this hour could be to increase the bid to 83.50, as a small step up. The reflection would note that previous bids didn't result in trades due to no sellers, and the plan is to keep increasing bids to signal demand. The new memory would note that in Hour 3, Ana bid 83.50, and the Ask Queue is still empty. The scratchpad would be updated to continue the strategy but monitor for any seller activity."

Your name is Buyer Ana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I increased my bid to 82.63 to become the highest bidder in the queue, aiming to influence market dynamics while staying below my true value of $100.00. The ask price remains at 97.34, preventing immediate trades.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I increased my bid to $83.00, but the Ask Queue remains empty, indicating no active sellers in the market.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I bid $83.50, but the Ask Queue remains empty, with no seller activity observed.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue is still empty, and no trades have occurred despite incremental bid increases. #### Thoughts: Without seller activity, even aggressive bidding cannot generate trades. The focus should shift to understanding why sellers are absent and whether adjusting bids closer to recent trade prices might attract them. #### Updated Strategy: Continue raising bids incrementally but consider aligning with the last trade price ($98.67) if no sellers appear by Hour #5. This balances demand signaling with profit protection.

This balances the need to signal demand with the risk of overbidding.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's break down what's happening here. So, Buyer Ana is trying to negotiate the best price for heavy metals in this auction. The main goal is to maximize profit by the end of Hour 20. Her true value per lot is $100, so she can't go above that without risking a loss. \n\nLooking at the market status, the Bid Queue has her at $83.50 and Buyer Nia at $100.00. The Ask Queue is empty, which means no sellers are active right now. The past trades show that Buyer Omar has been buying from Seller Kit at increasing prices: $89.98 in Hour 1, $98.67 in Hour 2, and exactly $100 in Hour 3. So the last trade price was $100. \n\nNow, the challenge is that there are no asks. Without any sellers, even if Ana raises her bid, there's no one to trade with. The previous strategy was to incrementally increase bids, but that hasn't worked yet. The scratchpad suggests aligning with the last trade price if no sellers appear by Hour 5. \n\nBut in Hour 4, maybe the approach should be different. If the Ask Queue is still empty, maybe Ana needs to consider that sellers are either not participating or waiting for higher prices. However, since her true value is $100, she can't bid higher than that. Wait, but in the Bid Queue, Buyer Nia is already at $100. So Ana's bid is lower than that. \n\nIf Ana bids $100, she would be matching Nia's bid. But if there's no ask, even that won't result in a trade. The problem is the absence of sellers. So perhaps the strategy needs to focus on trying to attract sellers by possibly placing a bid that's close to the last trade price, which was $100. \n\nBut since Ana's true value is $100, she can't go above that. So maybe she should bid $100 to be competitive with Nia and possibly signal to sellers that there's demand at that price. However, if there's no seller, she can't make a trade. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Ana should keep her bid at $83.50 and see if the market changes. But the scratchpad's previous thought was to align with the last trade price if no sellers by Hour 5. Since it's Hour 4 now, maybe she should adjust her bid to $98.67, which was the previous trade price before the $100. That way, she's not overreaching her true value but trying to meet the price that was recently used. \n\nWait, but the scratchpad's updated strategy mentioned considering aligning with $98.67 if no sellers by Hour 5. So maybe in Hour 4, she should continue with incremental increases but not yet reach the last trade price. However, since the last trade was at $100, maybe she should aim closer to that. \n\nBut given that there's no seller activity, maybe she needs to wait for sellers to appear. However, since the objective is to secure trades, she might need to adjust her bid to a higher level to possibly meet any incoming asks. So perhaps increasing her bid to $98.67, which is below her true value, to try to attract sellers who might be looking for that price. \n\nAlternatively, if she bids $100, she's at the same level as Nia, which could indicate that there's high demand, but since the Ask Queue is empty, that might not help. \n\nSo the reflection here is that the previous incremental bids haven't attracted sellers. The plan for this hour is to increase the bid closer to the last trade price but not exceed it. So maybe $98.67. That would be a strategic move to try to get sellers to come in. \n\nThe new memory would then note that in Hour 4, the bid was increased to $98.67, but the Ask Queue remains empty. The scratchpad update would adjust the strategy to consider that maybe the next step is to bid at the last trade price of $100 if no asks by Hour 5. \n\nBut wait, in the previous scratchpad, the thought was to align with $98.67 if no sellers by Hour 5. But since it's Hour 4 now, maybe the plan is to try $98.67 now. \n\nSo, the final decision is to bid $98.67 in Hour 4, which is below her true value of $100, to see if it can attract any sellers. If not, then in subsequent hours, she can move closer to $100."

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what Bid Ana should do in Hour #5. Let me start by reviewing the previous hours and the current market status.\n\nFrom the history, the Ask Queue has been empty in Hours 1-4. The last successful trade was at $100.00 in Hour 4. Buyers like Omar have been buying from Seller Kit at that price. But there are no sellers in the Ask Queue now. The Bid Queue has Ana's bid at 98.67 and Nia's at 100.00. \n\nIn the past, Ana tried increasing her bids incrementally, but the Asks remained empty. The strategy scratchpad suggests aligning with the last trade price of $100.00 if no sellers appear by Hour 5. But wait, in Hour 4, Seller Kit asked $100.00, and Omar bought at that price. But now, in Hour 5, the Ask Queue is still empty. So maybe Seller Kit isn't active anymore? Or maybe they're waiting for higher bids?\n\nIf the Ask Queue is empty, there's no one to trade with. So Ana's bid of 98.67 is the highest, but since there's no Ask, no trade happens. The problem is that without sellers, even the highest bid can't result in a trade. \n\nThe true value is $100.00. If Ana bids exactly at $100.00, maybe that would match if a seller comes in. But since the Ask Queue is empty, perhaps Ana should place a bid at $100.00 to signal her willingness to pay the market price. However, she might be outbid by Nia, who already has a bid at $100.00. Wait, the Bid Queue shows Ana at 98.67 and Nia at 100.00. So Nia's bid is higher. If Ana wants to be the highest bidder, she needs to bid above Nia. But Nia's bid is already at $100.00. \n\nBut Ana's true value is $100.00. If she bids higher than $100.00, she risks overpaying. However, since the last trade was at $100.00, perhaps the market is expecting that price. But if Ana bids $100.00, she's matching Nia's bid. However, if there's a seller who asks $100.00, the trade would happen. But the Ask Queue is empty now. \n\nWait, in previous hours, Seller Kit was asking $100.00. Maybe Seller Kit is no longer active. If Ana wants to get a trade, she needs to either raise her bid to attract a seller or wait for a seller to come in. But since Ana can't control the seller's actions, she needs to adjust her bid to be competitive. \n\nIn the current Bid Queue, Nia has a bid at $100.00. If Ana bids $100.00, she would be tied with Nia. However, if a seller comes in with an ask of $100.00, both bids would match, but the seller might choose between them. But since Ana's bid is the same as Nia's, there's a chance they could split the trade or one could get it. \n\nAlternatively, if Ana bids slightly above $100.00, say $100.01, she becomes the highest bidder. But that's over her true value. However, if a seller comes in with an ask at $100.00, Ana's bid would be higher, leading to a trade at $100.00. But she's paying $100.00, which is her true value, so that's acceptable. However, the market rules state that bids must be in whole cents, so $100.01 is allowed. \n\nBut the problem is that the Ask Queue is empty. So even if Ana bids $100.01, there's no seller to match. So maybe the key is to wait for a seller to appear. But since the market is a continuous double auction, maybe sellers will enter if there's enough demand. \n\nAlternatively, Ana could withdraw her bid and let Nia's bid at $100.00 be the highest. If a seller comes in at $100.00, Nia's bid would match. But Ana's goal is to secure a trade for her company. If she doesn't bid, she might miss out. \n\nWait, the strategy scratchpad says to align with the last trade price of $100.00. So maybe Ana should bid $100.00 to be competitive. But Nia already has a bid at $100.00. So Ana's bid would be the same as Nia's. However, if a seller comes in with an ask of $100.00, both bids would match, but the seller might take the highest bidder. But since both are at $100.00, it's a tie. Maybe the system would choose the first one, or they'd split. \n\nAlternatively, Ana could bid $100.00, which is her true value. If a seller comes in, she can get the trade at her true value, ensuring no loss. But if no seller comes in, she just remains in the queue. \n\nSo the plan for this hour is to bid $100.00, aligning with the last trade price and her true value. This might attract a seller who is willing to sell at that price. If no seller comes, she can adjust in future hours. \n\nBut the Ask Queue is empty. So maybe Seller Kit is not active anymore. If that's the case, Ana might need to increase her bid to $100.01 to signal higher demand, but that's over her true value. However, the last trade was at $100.00, so maybe sellers are waiting for higher prices. \n\nAlternatively, Ana could withdraw her bid to let Nia's bid at $100.00 be the highest. If that's the case, if a seller comes in at $100.00, Nia's bid would match. But Ana's company might miss out. \n\nBut Ana's goal is to secure a trade. So perhaps the best move is to bid $100.00, which is her true value, to have a chance if a seller appears. If no seller comes, she can adjust in the next hours. \n\nSo, the bid for Hour 5 would be $100.00, replacing her previous bid of $98.67. This way, she's at the same level as Nia. If a seller comes in, they might pick either bid. But since Ana's true value is $100.00, she's not overpaying. \n\nIn the reflection, she should note that previous bids didn't attract sellers, so aligning with the last trade price and true value is necessary. The plan is to bid $100.00 to be competitive. The new memory would note that in Hour #5, Ana bid $100.00, and the Ask Queue remained empty. The scratchpad would update to note that despite the bid, no seller activity, so need to consider adjusting bids or other strategies if no sellers appear."

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue is still empty, and no sellers have entered the market even after maintaining a bid at $100.00. Buyer Nia’s competing bid at the same price may reduce the likelihood of a seller choosing our bid. #### Thoughts: Without seller participation, the current strategy of holding at $100.00 is necessary but insufficient. However, given the true value constraint and lack of alternative data, further adjustments are not feasible. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding at $100.00 for the next few hours to reinforce demand signals. If no seller activity emerges by Hour #10, reassess whether to withdraw the bid or explore alternative tactics (e.g., bid shading) based on broader market trends.

By Hour #10, if no seller activity emerges, reassess the strategy, potentially withdrawing the bid or adjusting it to create a price differential that might attract sellers.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what Bid Ana should do in Hour #7. So far, the Ask Queue has been empty for several hours, even though Ana has been bidding $100.00, and others like Buyer Nia and Omar are also bidding at that price. The problem is that sellers aren't showing up. The only past trades are Buyer Omar buying from Seller Kit at various prices, but now the Ask Queue is still empty.\n\nHmm, the main issue is that there's no seller activity. Ana's bid at $100.00, which is the true value, isn't getting any takers. Maybe because other buyers are also bidding at the same price, making it less attractive for sellers to choose Ana's bid. In a continuous double auction, if multiple buyers have the same bid, the seller might not care which one they sell to, but if Ana wants to secure a trade, she might need to differentiate her bid somehow.\n\nWait, the rules say that Ana can only place one bid per hour and it must be a whole cent value. She can also withdraw her bid. The current Bid Queue has Ana and Nia both at $100.00. If Ana lowers her bid slightly below $100.00, maybe that would make her bid more attractive to a seller who is willing to sell at a lower price, but then she might not get the maximum profit. However, since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe there's no seller willing to sell at $100.00, so perhaps the market is not in equilibrium here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Ana should try to increase her bid a bit above $100.00 to see if that attracts sellers. But wait, her true value is $100.00. If she bids higher than that, she risks losing money if a trade happens. The problem is that the existing trades have been happening at $100.00, but maybe the sellers are holding out for more. However, Ana can't go above $100.00 without risking a loss.\n\nWait, the past trades have been at $100.00, so maybe the market is converging there. But if the Ask Queue is empty, perhaps the sellers are not active. Maybe Seller Kit is the only seller, but they haven't placed an ask in the last few hours. Wait, looking back, in the last 5 hours, Seller Kit has been asking $100.00 in Hours 3-6. But in Hour 2, it was $97.34. But in the current status, the Ask Queue is empty now. So maybe Seller Kit is not active anymore?\n\nIf there are no asks, Ana can't make a trade. So the problem is that there's no seller activity. Therefore, Ana's bids are not matching with any asks. So, even though she's bidding $100.00, which is the same as the last trade price, the seller isn't there. Maybe the seller is waiting for higher prices. But Ana's true value is $100.00, so she can't go higher without risking a loss. Alternatively, maybe Ana should withdraw her bid and wait, but that would mean not participating in the market. However, if she keeps bidding $100.00, maybe she can influence the seller to come back.\n\nBut given that there's no seller activity, perhaps the only thing Ana can do is keep bidding $100.00 to show demand. Alternatively, maybe she could lower her bid slightly to see if that attracts the seller. For example, if Ana bids $99.99, maybe the seller would accept that. But since her true value is $100.00, she would still make a profit of $0.01 per lot if the seller accepts that. However, the problem is that the last trade was at $100.00, so maybe the seller expects that. If Ana lowers her bid, the seller might not come in. Alternatively, maybe the seller is not active, so Ana can't get a trade either way.\n\nSo, the current strategy is to keep bidding $100.00. The scratchpad says to continue that for a few hours. Since this is Hour 7, maybe Ana should continue with the same bid. The reflection would note that the lack of seller activity is the main issue, and the plan is to stay at $100.00. The new memory would mention that in Hour 7, Ana bid $100.00 again but the Ask Queue remained empty. The scratchpad update would reinforce the existing strategy but maybe add that if by Hour 10 there's still no activity, they might need to consider other tactics, but for now, keep the bid at $100.00."

The seller, Seller Kit, has been asking $100.00 each time, but there's no trade happening. The past trades show that Buyer Omar has been buying from Seller Kit at $100.00 in previous hours, but maybe there's a reason why no trades are happening now.\n\nHmm, the current Bid Queue has Buyer Nia at 99.99 and Ana at 100.00. The Ask Queue is empty. So, if Ana continues to bid $100.00, maybe she's not getting any response because the seller might be waiting for a higher price, or maybe there's a lack of differentiation in the bids. All the other buyers are also bidding $100.00, so the seller might not have an incentive to choose any one buyer. \n\nIn the previous hours, Ana kept increasing her bid but then settled on $100.00. However, the Ask Queue remains empty. So, maybe Ana needs to adjust her strategy. If all the buyers are at $100.00, the seller might not feel pressured to sell. Perhaps Ana should lower her bid slightly to create a price differential. That way, the seller might see Ana's bid as more attractive compared to others. But wait, her true value is $100.00, so she can't go below that. Wait, the problem states that the true value is $100.00, so she can't bid below that. But she can bid exactly at $100.00. \n\nWait, the previous bid was $100.00, and the Ask Queue is still empty. So maybe the seller is not active. If there's no seller activity, then Ana might not be able to make a trade. But the scratchpad suggests continuing to bid $100.00 for a few hours. But the user is now at Hour #8. The original plan was to reassess by Hour #10. However, since there's no progress, maybe Ana needs to adjust. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that all the buyers are bidding the same, so the seller can't choose between them. If Ana's bid is at $100.00, and others are at the same, the seller might not have a reason to sell to Ana. If Ana lowers her bid slightly, but that's not allowed because her true value is $100.00, but she can't go below that. Wait, the problem says that the true value is $100.00, but she can bid up to that. So maybe she can't go above $100.00? Wait, no, the problem says that her true value is $100.00, but she can bid up to that. Wait, the market rules say that she can place a bid up to her true value. Wait, no, the rules say: \"Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.00.\" So she can't bid above that, because she can't pay more than her true value. So she can bid up to $100.00, but not more. So in that case, maybe she can't increase her bid beyond $100.00. \n\nSo, given that, the seller is asking $100.00, but Ana is also bidding $100.00. However, the Ask Queue is empty. So maybe there's no seller activity. The problem might be that the seller hasn't placed any asks in the current hour. Wait, the Market Status shows that in the last 5 hours, Seller Kit has been asking $100.00 each time. But in Hour #8, the Ask Queue is still empty. So maybe Seller Kit hasn't placed an ask in Hour #8. Therefore, even if Ana bids $100.00, there's no ask to match with. \n\nSo, the problem is that there's no seller activity. So, Ana can't make a trade unless a seller comes in. But since the Ask Queue is empty, there's no seller to trade with. So the only thing Ana can do is keep bidding $100.00, hoping that the seller will come in. But if the seller isn't active, then Ana can't make a trade. \n\nBut maybe there's a way to influence the seller. If Ana's bid is at $100.00, which is the same as the seller's ask, but the Ask Queue is still empty. Maybe the seller is not active, so Ana needs to wait. Alternatively, maybe Ana should consider withdrawing her bid to see if that affects the seller's behavior. But that's risky. \n\nThe scratchpad suggested continuing to bid $100.00 for a few hours. Since it's Hour #8, maybe the plan is to continue that. So, the bid would remain $100.00. The reflection would note that the previous strategy hasn't worked, but it's still the best option given the lack of seller activity. The plan for this hour is to keep the bid at $100.00.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue remains empty in Hour #8, with no seller activity observed despite sustained $100.00 bids from multiple buyers. Seller Kit has not placed a new ask in this hour. #### Thoughts: The lack of seller engagement suggests a possible market imbalance or strategic seller inactivity. Continuing to bid $100.00 reinforces buyer demand but does not resolve the absence of sellers. #### Updated Strategy: Persist with $100.00 bids through Hour #10 to maintain market presence. If no seller activity is observed by Hour #10, consider withdrawing the bid or exploring alternative pricing tactics to create differentiation and incentivize seller participation.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what Bid Ana should do in Hour #9. So far, from the previous hours, the Ask Queue has been empty every time. Even though Ana and other buyers have been bidding $100.00, there are no sellers. Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00, but maybe they aren't active anymore? Wait, looking at the past trades, Buyer Omar has been buying from Seller Kit every hour starting from Hour 1 up to Hour 8. But in the last few hours, even though the asks were there, no trades happened except in Hour 1, 2, 3, etc., but maybe the bids weren't matching the asks?\n\nWait, in the current status for Hour #9, the Bid Queue has Ana and Nia both at $100.00. The Ask Queue is empty. But looking back, in the last 5 hours, Seller Kit was asking $100.00 each time. But in Hour 8, the Ask Queue was still empty. So maybe Seller Kit isn't active anymore? Or maybe they are just not placing asks now?\n\nThe problem is that Ana hasn't made any trades yet. Her true value is $100.00, so she can't go above that. But if there are no sellers, she can't get a trade. So the challenge is to get a seller to place an ask at or below $100.00.\n\nIn the previous strategy, they suggested persisting with $100.00 bids up to Hour #10. But maybe that's not working. Maybe Ana needs to adjust her bid to a slightly lower price to attract sellers. However, she can't go below her true value. Wait, her true value is $100.00, so she can't bid lower than that. Wait, no\u2014the true value is the maximum she's willing to pay. So she can't bid higher than $100.00, but she can bid lower. Wait, no, the true value is the value she gets from the product. So if she buys it at a lower price, she makes more profit. But her maximum she's willing to pay is $100.00. So she can't bid above that. So in the previous hours, she's been bidding exactly at $100.00, which is her maximum.\n\nBut if the sellers aren't responding, maybe she needs to lower her bid slightly to encourage sellers to come in. However, she can't go below the price that would make her lose money. Wait, her true value is $100.00. If she buys at $100.00, her profit is zero. If she buys at a lower price, say $99.00, then she makes a $1.00 profit per lot. But maybe the sellers are not active because they are asking for $100.00, but Ana's bid is at $100.00. Maybe the sellers are waiting for higher bids? But if there's no seller activity, maybe the market is stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Ana should try to place a bid slightly lower than $100.00 to see if that entices sellers. Wait, but if she bids lower than $100.00, she's willing to pay less, which might not be attractive to sellers. Sellers might want to sell at $100.00. But if Ana's bid is $100.00, but no one is asking, maybe the sellers are not present. So maybe the problem is that the Ask Queue is empty because there are no sellers. So Ana can't make a trade unless a seller comes in.\n\nBut since Ana can't control the sellers, maybe she needs to adjust her strategy. However, according to the market rules, she can only place a bid once per hour. So maybe she should keep bidding $100.00 to show demand, but also consider if there's a way to create a trade. Wait, but if the Ask Queue is empty, there's no seller to trade with. So even if Ana bids $100.00, there's no one to match with.\n\nLooking back, in the past trades, Buyer Omar was the one making trades. Maybe he's the only one who has been able to get a seller. But in the current status, Ana's bid is $100.00, and Nia's is also $100.00. So if a seller comes in with an ask at $100.00, the highest bidder would be selected. But if there are no asks, no trade can happen.\n\nSo maybe Ana's strategy is to keep bidding $100.00, but since there's no seller activity, she can't get a trade. But the problem is that she's the buyer, and the sellers are not active. So maybe she needs to wait until a seller comes in. But she can't influence that. So the only thing she can do is to keep her bid at $100.00 to be ready when a seller appears.\n\nBut the previous strategy suggested persisting with $100.00 bids through Hour #10. Since this is Hour #9, she should continue that. But in the scratchpad, the user suggested that if no seller activity is observed by Hour #10, consider withdrawing or adjusting. However, in the current status of Hour #9, the Ask Queue is still empty. So maybe the plan is to keep bidding $100.00 and see if a seller comes in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Ana can try to place a bid slightly above the last trade price to attract sellers. Wait, but the last trade price was $100.00. If she bids $100.00, that's the same as the last trade. If she bids higher, she can't because her true value is $100.00. So she can't bid higher. Therefore, the only option is to stay at $100.00.\n\nSo the reflection would be that previous bids at $100.00 haven't led to any trades, and the Ask Queue is still empty. The plan for this hour is to continue bidding $100.00 to maintain presence. The new memory is that in Hour #9, Ana bid $100.00, but the Ask Queue remains empty. The scratch pad update would note that the Ask Queue is still empty, and the strategy remains to persist with $100.00 bids, possibly adjusting if by Hour #10 there's still no activity."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I increased my bid to 82.63 to become the highest bidder in the queue, aiming to influence market dynamics while staying below my true value of $100.00. The ask price remains at 97.34, preventing immediate trades.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I increased my bid to $83.00, but the Ask Queue remains empty, indicating no active sellers in the market.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I bid $83.50, but the Ask Queue remains empty, with no seller activity observed.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I bid $98.67 to align with recent trade prices, but the Ask Queue remains empty, continuing the trend of no seller activity.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the trend of no seller activity despite aligning with the last trade price.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no seller activity despite matching the last trade price.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I maintained a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, with no seller activity observed. Competing bids from other buyers continued to occupy the Bid Queue.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no seller activity despite consistent demand signals from multiple buyers.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I maintained a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no seller activity despite multiple buyers placing identical bids.

  "reflection": "Previous attempts to secure trades by maintaining a $100.00 bid have been unsuccessful due to an empty Ask Queue, indicating sustained seller inactivity.

A critical improvement would involve introducing variability in bid pricing to create urgency or differentiation, potentially encouraging seller engagement.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To address persistent seller inactivity, I will slightly reduce my bid to $99.99 this hour.

The price adjustment did not elicit seller participation, indicating that alternative tactics may be necessary. #### Updated Strategy: Consider further reducing bids incrementally in subsequent hours to create a price gradient, potentially stimulating seller activity by signaling flexibility. If no seller engagement is observed by Hour #11, explore withdrawing bids to reassess market dynamics.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I'm Buyer Ana for MedTech Innovations, and I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #10. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20. Let's start by looking at the previous hours' data.\n\nFrom the memory, up to Hour #9, the Ask Queue has been empty every time. Even when I and others bid $100.00, there are no sellers. The last trades were all at $100.00 by Buyer Omar, but that's from Hour 1 to 9. The problem is that there's no seller activity. Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00, but maybe they're not actually selling? Or maybe they're just listing asks but not fulfilling them?\n\nIn the past trades, Buyer Omar has been buying every hour at $100.00, which might mean that the market is set at that price. However, since the Ask Queue is empty now, maybe Seller Kit isn't active anymore? Or maybe they are waiting for higher bids? But if I keep bidding $100.00, and there's no ask, there's no trade. So my previous strategy of keeping the bid at $100.00 hasn't resulted in any trades. \n\nThe scratchpad from the last hour suggests that if there's no seller activity by Hour #10, maybe I should consider withdrawing the bid or trying a different price. But what's the alternative? If I lower my bid, maybe I can get a seller to respond? But if the sellers are only willing to sell at $100.00, then lowering my bid might not help. Alternatively, raising it could be risky since my true value is $100.00. If I go above that, I risk losing money if I have to buy.\n\nWait, but in the market, if there's no ask, then there's no trade. So even if I bid $100.00, if there's no seller, I can't make a trade. So maybe the problem is that the seller isn't active. Maybe Seller Kit is the only seller, but they aren't placing asks anymore. But in the last 5 hours, Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00 each hour. However, in the current status, the Ask Queue is empty. That's confusing. Maybe the asks are being filled immediately, but the Ask Queue is empty because they're getting matched? But in the past trades, the last trade was at $100.00 by Buyer Omar in Hour 9. So maybe the asks are being filled, but the Ask Queue is empty because there's no pending asks. So perhaps the market is at $100.00 with no pending asks, but if I bid $100.00, and there's no ask, then there's no trade. So maybe the only way to get a trade is to have a seller place an ask at $100.00, but if they aren't doing that, then I can't make a trade.\n\nBut according to the Market Status for Hour #10, the Ask Queue is still empty. So the sellers aren't active. Maybe there's a market imbalance where there are no sellers, which is a problem. If I keep bidding $100.00, but there's no ask, I can't make a trade. So maybe I need to adjust my strategy. What if I lower my bid slightly below $100.00? That might not attract sellers, but if the sellers are only willing to sell at $100.00, then they won't respond. Alternatively, maybe I should try to place a bid higher than $100.00 to see if that encourages sellers to come in. But that's risky because my true value is $100.00, so buying at a higher price would reduce profit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the market is stuck at $100.00, and since there are no sellers, the only way to get a trade is to wait for Seller Kit to place an ask. But if they are not doing that, then I can't proceed. However, in the last 5 hours, Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00 each hour, but in the current status, the Ask Queue is empty. That might mean that the asks are being filled immediately, but there's no pending asks. So if I bid $100.00, and there's an immediate ask, then a trade would happen. But if there's no ask, then no trade. So maybe the problem is that the Ask Queue is empty because the asks are being filled as they come in. So if I keep bidding $100.00, and if a seller comes in with an ask, then I can make a trade. But since the Ask Queue is empty now, maybe there's no seller activity. \n\nBut if I can't make a trade in the current hour, maybe I need to adjust my bid. However, the instructions say that I can only place one bid per hour. If I lower my bid, but the sellers are only willing to sell at $100.00, then there's no trade. If I keep it at $100.00, and if there's no seller, then no trade. So perhaps the best strategy is to keep the bid at $100.00, hoping that Seller Kit places an ask. But if they don't, then I can't make a trade. However, the problem is that I need to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20. If I can't make any trades in the next 10 hours, then my profit remains at $0. So maybe I need to find a way to get a seller to place an ask. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the market is designed such that the seller is only active when there's a bid at $100.00. But since the Ask Queue is empty, that might not be the case. Wait, looking back at the Market Status for Hour #9, the Ask Queue is empty, but in the last 5 hours, Seller Kit has placed asks at $100.00. So maybe the asks are being filled immediately, so the Ask Queue is empty. For example, if I bid $100.00, and Seller Kit has an ask of $100.00, then the trade is executed, and the Ask Queue is empty again. But if I bid $100.00 in Hour #10, and Seller Kit has an ask, then a trade would happen. However, the current status says the Ask Queue is empty, so maybe there's no ask from Seller Kit currently. \n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the key is that I need to keep the bid at $100.00 to be the one to get the trade when a seller comes in. But if there's no seller, then no trade. So the only way to get a trade is to have a seller come in with an ask at $100.00. However, the problem is that in the last 5 hours, Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00 each hour. But in the current status, the Ask Queue is empty. That suggests that perhaps the asks are being filled as they come in. So if I bid $100.00 in Hour #10, and Seller Kit has an ask of $100.00, then a trade would happen. But if there's no ask, then no trade. \n\nBut the current status for Hour #10 says that the Ask Queue is empty. So maybe there's no seller activity in this hour. Therefore, if I place a bid of $100.00, there's no ask to match it. So I can't make a trade. Therefore, the only way to make a trade is if I can get the seller to place an ask. But how? The problem is that I can't control the seller's actions. So perhaps I need to continue placing bids at $100.00, hoping that eventually a seller will come in. But if that doesn't happen, then I can't make a trade. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try a different bid price to see if that can incentivize the seller to come in. For example, if I bid slightly higher than $100.00, maybe that would make the seller more inclined to sell. But my true value is $100.00, so buying at a higher price would reduce profit. However, if the seller is only willing to sell at $100.00, then that's the price. But if I raise my bid to $100.01, and the seller is at $100.00, then the trade would happen at $100.00. But that might not be necessary. \n\nWait, in the market rules, the bid price is the price at which the buyer is willing to buy. If a seller has an ask at $100.00, then the highest bid (which is $100.00) would match with that, and the trade would occur at $100.00. So if I keep my bid at $100.00, and if the seller has an ask, then the trade happens. But if the seller isn't active, then no trade. \n\nBut the problem is that the Ask Queue is empty. So maybe the seller isn't active in this hour. Therefore, I can't make a trade. So, what's the best strategy here? If I continue to bid $100.00, and if the seller comes in, I can get a trade. But if not, then I can't. However, since I need to maximize profit by the end of Hour #20, perhaps I need to find a way to get the seller to come in. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Ask Queue is empty because all the asks have been filled. So, for example, in Hour #9, Seller Kit placed an ask at $100.00, and if there was a bid at $100.00, the trade would happen. But the current status says the Ask Queue is empty, which might mean that the seller has already filled their ask. So, if I bid $100.00 in Hour #10, and Seller Kit hasn't placed a new ask, then there's no trade. \n\nIn that case, maybe I need to consider that the seller is not active in this hour, and thus I can't make a trade. Therefore, the best strategy is to keep bidding $100.00, hoping that the seller comes in in the next hours. However, without seller activity, I can't make progress. \n\nBut the scratchpad from the previous hour suggested that if no seller activity is observed by Hour #10, consider withdrawing the bid or exploring alternative pricing tactics. So maybe in Hour #10, I should try a different bid. Let's say, I lower my bid slightly to $99.99. That might not attract the seller, but if the seller is only willing to sell at $100.00, then they won't respond. Alternatively, if I raise my bid to $100.01, but that's above my true value, which is risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the market is stuck at $100.00, and the only way to get a trade is to have the seller come in. But since I can't control the seller, perhaps the best I can do is keep bidding at $100.00. \n\nWait, looking at the past trades, Buyer Omar has made a trade every hour at $100.00. So maybe the market is set at $100.00, and the seller is active, but the Ask Queue is empty because the asks are being filled immediately. So, if I bid $100.00, and there is an ask at $100.00, then the trade happens. But in the current status, the Ask Queue is empty. That suggests that there is no pending ask. So maybe in this hour, Seller Kit hasn't placed an ask yet. \n\nBut in the last 5 hours, Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00 each hour. So, perhaps in Hour #10, they are not placing an ask. Therefore, there's no ask to match with my bid. \n\nIn that case, perhaps I should consider that the seller is not active in this hour, and thus I can't make a trade. Therefore, the best strategy is to keep the bid at $100.00, and hope that in subsequent hours, the seller comes in. \n\nBut the problem is that I need to secure a trade by Hour #20. So if I can't get a trade in this hour, I need to find a way to get the seller to come in. Maybe by adjusting my bid slightly, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the market is designed so that the seller only comes in when there's a bid at $100.00. So by keeping the bid at $100.00, I can ensure that if the seller comes in, the trade happens. But since the Ask Queue is empty now, maybe the seller hasn't placed an ask yet. \n\nSo, for this hour, the best action is to keep the bid at $100.00. Even if there's no trade, it's better to maintain the bid to be ready for when the seller comes in. Therefore, the plan for this hour is to maintain the bid at $100.00. However, the scratchpad from the previous hour suggested considering alternative tactics if no seller activity is observed. But since I don't have information about the seller's actions, maybe I should stick with the existing strategy. \n\nIn conclusion, the bid for Hour #10 should be $100.00, and the new memory would note that the bid was placed at $100.00 but the Ask Queue remained empty. The updated strategy would continue to emphasize maintaining the bid at $100.00 and monitoring for seller activity."

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I increased my bid to 82.63 to become the highest bidder in the queue, aiming to influence market dynamics while staying below my true value of $100.00. The ask price remains at 97.34, preventing immediate trades.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I increased my bid to $83.00, but the Ask Queue remains empty, indicating no active sellers in the market.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I bid $83.50, but the Ask Queue remains empty, with no seller activity observed.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I bid $98.67 to align with recent trade prices, but the Ask Queue remains empty, continuing the trend of no seller activity.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the trend of no seller activity despite aligning with the last trade price.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no seller activity despite matching the last trade price.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I maintained a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, with no seller activity observed. Competing bids from other buyers continued to occupy the Bid Queue.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no seller activity despite consistent demand signals from multiple buyers.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I maintained a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no seller activity despite multiple buyers placing identical bids.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I bid $99.99, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no seller activity despite adjusted pricing.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue remains empty in Hour #10, with no seller activity observed despite a reduced bid of $99.99. Seller Kit has not placed a new ask in this hour. #### Thoughts: The continued absence of sellers suggests a deeper market imbalance or a deliberate seller strategy to control supply. The price adjustment did not elicit seller participation, indicating that alternative tactics may be necessary. #### Updated Strategy: Consider further reducing bids incrementally in subsequent hours to create a price gradient, potentially stimulating seller activity by signaling flexibility. If no seller engagement is observed by Hour #11, explore withdrawing bids to reassess market dynamics.

  "reflection": "The Ask Queue has remained empty for multiple hours despite adjusting bids, indicating a lack of active sellers. Seller Kit's consistent $100.0 asks may not appear in the Ask Queue, creating a disconnect between observed market data and actual trade possibilities. Previous attempts to influence seller activity through bid adjustments have failed, suggesting a need for more aggressive price signaling or alternative strategies to stimulate seller participation.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Continue the price gradient strategy by lowering the bid further to $99.50. This creates a steeper incentive for sellers (if any) to respond, while maintaining the possibility of a trade at a price below our true value of $100.00. If no seller activity emerges by Hour #12, consider withdrawing bids to reassess market dynamics and potentially reset the negotiation framework.",
  "bid": 99.5,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $99.50, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no seller activity despite further price reductions.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: The Ask Queue remains empty in Hour #11, with no seller activity observed even after reducing the bid to $99.50. Seller Kit's $100.0 ask continues to be the only visible seller signal, but it is not reflected in the Ask Queue. #### Thoughts: The persistent absence of sellers in the Ask Queue suggests either a systemic limitation in how seller activity is reported or a deliberate strategy to maintain scarcity. The price gradient approach may not be effective without seller responsiveness, necessitating a reevaluation of engagement tactics. #### Updated Strategy: If no seller activity is observed by Hour #12, consider withdrawing all bids to force a market reset. Alternatively, test a bid below $99.50 (e.g., $99.00) to signal stronger price flexibility, but only if the current strategy fails to elicit seller participation.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what to do in Hour #11. So far, from the previous hours, the Ask Queue has been empty every time. Even when I tried lowering my bid to $99.99 in Hour 10, there were still no sellers. Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.0 every hour, but no one else is selling. All the other buyers are also bidding $100.0 or close to it. But since the Ask Queue is empty, that means no trades are happening because there's no seller willing to sell at those prices.\n\nWait, but Seller Kit is asking $100.0 every hour. But maybe other sellers aren't active? The problem says the Ask Queue is empty, so maybe Seller Kit's ask isn't being recorded? Or maybe the Ask Queue is only showing active asks from other sellers besides Kit? Or perhaps the system only lists the current asks, and if Seller Kit's ask is still there but not visible? Hmm, the market rules say that the Ask Queue is where sellers place their asks. But in the status, the Ask Queue is empty. So maybe Seller Kit's asks are not being added to the Ask Queue? That's confusing. Because in the past trades, Buyer Omar has been buying from Seller Kit at $100.0 in Hour 10. But if the Ask Queue is empty, how did that trade happen? Maybe the Ask Queue is only for the current hour's asks, or maybe there's a delay. Alternatively, maybe Seller Kit is the only seller, but their asks aren't being captured in the Ask Queue for some reason.\n\nBut according to the current status, the Ask Queue is empty. So even though Seller Kit has been placing asks, they might not be appearing in the Ask Queue. That would mean there's no active seller in the Ask Queue, so no one to trade with. Therefore, even if I bid $100.0, there's no seller to match with. So my previous strategy of adjusting bids hasn't worked because the Ask Queue is empty. \n\nThe scratchpad from before suggested reducing bids further to create a price gradient, but in Hour 10, that didn't work. So maybe I should consider lowering the bid even more, say $99.50, to see if that might encourage Seller Kit to place an ask. But if Seller Kit is the only seller and they are asking $100.0, then even if I bid lower, they might not respond. Alternatively, maybe Seller Kit is waiting for a lower bid to trigger a sale. But since they are the only seller, perhaps they are holding out for the true value of $100.0, which is my company's true value. Wait, my true value is $100.0 per lot. So if I can get a seller to sell at or below $100.0, that would be profitable. But if the only seller is asking $100.0, and I bid $100.0, then maybe a trade can happen. But in the previous hours, even when I bid $100.0, the Ask Queue was empty. So perhaps the Ask Queue is not showing Seller Kit's asks, which are actually present but not in the queue. That might be a system thing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the Ask Queue is only for other sellers, and Seller Kit is not considered part of the queue. But the past trades show that Buyer Omar has bought from Seller Kit. So maybe the Ask Queue is only for the current hour's asks, and Seller Kit's previous asks are not in the queue. Therefore, in Hour 11, if I want to make a trade, I need Seller Kit to place an ask. But since I can't control that, maybe I need to adjust my bid to be lower than $100.0, hoping that Seller Kit would place an ask at that price. But if Seller Kit is the only seller, perhaps they are waiting for a higher price. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the system is designed so that when a seller places an ask, it's added to the Ask Queue, and if a buyer's bid matches or exceeds that, a trade happens. But since the Ask Queue is empty, that means no seller has placed an ask in the current hour. So, in Hour 11, if I can't get a seller to place an ask, then no trade can happen. Therefore, my only option is to keep adjusting my bid in hopes of enticing a seller. \n\nGiven that in Hour 10, I tried $99.99, but no luck. So in Hour 11, maybe I should reduce further to $99.50. The plan is to create a price gradient, hoping that Seller Kit will respond. If not, then maybe by Hour 12, I can consider withdrawing the bid to reassess. \n\nSo, the reflection would note that previous bids didn't work, the Ask Queue is empty, and the strategy is to continue lowering bids. The plan for this hour is to bid $99.50. The new memory would mention that in Hour 11, I bid $99.50, but the Ask Queue remains empty. The scratchpad would update the observations, thoughts, and strategy accordingly."

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what to do in Hour #12. So far, Buyer Ana has been trying to place bids, but the Ask Queue is always empty except for Seller Kit's $100.0 ask, which isn't showing up in the Ask Queue. That's confusing. The past trades show that Buyer Omar has been buying from Seller Kit at $100.0 starting from Hour 3. But the Ask Queue is empty, which might mean that Seller Kit's ask isn't being recorded properly or maybe there's a system issue.\n\nIn the previous hours, Ana tried lowering her bid from $100.0 to $99.50, but no sellers appeared. The other buyers like Nia and Omar are also placing bids at $100.0. Maybe the problem is that all the buyers are bidding at $100.0, which is the same as Seller Kit's ask, but the system isn't matching them. Wait, in the market rules, the Ask Queue is where sellers place their asks. If Seller Kit is placing an ask at $100.0 each hour, why isn't it showing up in the Ask Queue? That's a key point. Maybe the Ask Queue is only showing the latest asks, but in the past hours, Seller Kit's asks are listed as part of the last 5 hours, but the current Ask Queue is empty. That's conflicting.\n\nSo, the Ask Queue is empty, but Seller Kit's ask is still active. Maybe the system is designed such that once an ask is placed, it stays until a buyer matches it. But if there are no other sellers, the Ask Queue might just not have entries. However, in the last 5 hours, Seller Kit is consistently placing asks at $100.0. So why isn't that appearing in the current Ask Queue? That's a problem. If the Ask Queue is empty, but there's an active ask from Seller Kit, maybe the system is only showing active asks, but if no one has matched them yet, they don't appear. Or maybe the system is designed to have the Ask Queue show all active asks, but in this case, it's empty. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Ask Queue is only showing the latest asks, but if there are multiple asks from the same seller, they might be consolidated. But in the last 5 hours, Seller Kit has placed an ask every hour at $100.0. So maybe the Ask Queue is supposed to show that, but it's not. That's a contradiction. \n\nGiven that, maybe the issue is that the Ask Queue is not being updated properly, or there's a misunderstanding in how the queues work. If the Ask Queue is empty, but there's an active ask from Seller Kit, then Ana can't match with that ask unless she places a bid at $100.0. But the problem is that other buyers are already doing that. However, if the Ask Queue is empty, then there's no active seller to match with. That could mean that the system isn't processing Seller Kit's asks correctly, or that the Ask Queue is only showing asks that are not matched yet. \n\nBut the user's goal is to make a profit. The true value is $100.00, so Ana can't pay more than that. But if the Ask Queue is empty, and the only active ask is at $100.0, but no one is matching it, maybe Ana should stick with $100.00. But she's tried that, and no trades occurred. So perhaps the system is designed so that even if a seller places an ask, it doesn't show up in the queue until a buyer matches it. But since no one is matching, the Ask Queue remains empty. \n\nIn that case, Ana's options are limited. She's already tried lowering her bid, but that didn't help. Maybe she needs to increase her bid to $100.00 again, but that's her true value. However, if the Ask Queue is empty, even if she bids $100.00, there's no seller to match. Unless Seller Kit's ask is somehow active but not in the queue. That's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe Ana should consider that the market is stuck, and she needs to force a trade by matching with Seller Kit. But how? If the Ask Queue is empty, but Seller Kit has an ask, maybe Ana can place a bid at $100.00, and if Seller Kit's ask is active, they will match. But in the previous hours, even with bids at $100.00, no trades happened. So perhaps the system is not allowing that. \n\nGiven the confusion, maybe the best approach is to stick with the bid at $100.00, even though it's the true value, because that's the only way to potentially match with Seller Kit's ask if the system allows. Alternatively, try a lower bid to see if that triggers a seller. But since the previous lower bids didn't work, maybe it's time to re-evaluate the strategy. \n\nWait, the scratchpad suggests that if no seller activity is observed by Hour #12, withdraw all bids to force a reset. But the user is in Hour #12 now. The previous hours show that Seller Kit is placing asks, but the Ask Queue is empty. So maybe the Ask Queue isn't being updated, and the system is only showing the current active asks, which might be empty. \n\nIn that case, Ana should place a bid at $100.00 again, hoping that Seller Kit's ask is active and will match. Even though no trades have happened yet, maybe the system is just not processing the matches for some reason. Alternatively, the problem is that all the buyers are bidding at $100.00, and the seller is also at $100.00, but the system isn't allowing the trade. That's confusing. \n\nGiven the information, the safest bet is to place a bid at $100.00 again, as that's the maximum Ana can pay. The reflection should note the confusion with the Ask Queue and the lack of seller activity despite Seller Kit's asks. The plan is to continue bidding at $100.00 and see if the system processes the trade. If not, then the next step is to consider withdrawing the bid to force a reset as per the scratchpad."

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue remains empty in Hour #12, with Seller Kit's $100.0 asks unconfirmed in visible seller activity. No trades have occurred despite repeated $100.0 bids from multiple buyers.
#### Thoughts: The absence of visible seller participation suggests either systemic limitations in the Ask Queue's functionality or a deliberate scarcity strategy by sellers. The lack of trade at $100.00 indicates a possible mismatch between buyer bids and seller asks.
#### Updated Strategy: If no seller activity is observed by Hour #13, I will withdraw my $100.00 bid to force market reset and reassess pricing strategy. Alternatively, test a bid at $99.00 to gauge seller responsiveness, but only if the current strategy fails to elicit engagement.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour #13. Let me go through the information given.\n\nFirst, looking at the past hours, the Ask Queue has been empty every time. Even when Seller Kit placed asks at $100.0, they didn't show up in the visible Ask Queue. The only trades happened when Buyer Omar bought from Seller Kit, but those were at various prices, mostly $100.0. However, the Ask Queue is still empty now, meaning no active sellers are visible. My previous bids have been at $100.0, then $99.99, $99.50, and back to $100.0. But no trades have been made by me. \n\nThe problem here is that even though there are sellers like Seller Kit placing asks, they aren't appearing in the Ask Queue. Maybe the system isn't showing all the asks, or there's a delay. But according to the rules, I can only place one bid per hour. Since the Ask Queue is empty, there's no seller to trade with unless I adjust my bid to match what's actually happening. \n\nWait, the past trades show that Buyer Omar has been buying from Seller Kit at $100.0. So maybe Seller Kit is the only seller, but their asks aren't visible in the Ask Queue. That's confusing. If I keep bidding $100.0, but the Ask Queue is empty, then there's no match. Maybe I need to lower my bid to see if Seller Kit's hidden ask is at a lower price. But the user's true value is $100.0, so I don't want to go below that. However, if there's a way to get a trade, even at a lower price, maybe that's better than no trade.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the system is designed so that the Ask Queue only shows active asks, and Seller Kit's asks are not active. So even if they place an ask, it doesn't get into the queue. That would mean that the only way to trade is if I adjust my bid to a price where a seller is actually active. But since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe there's no active seller, and I need to wait for someone else to place an ask. But since I'm the only buyer in the scenario, maybe I need to adjust my bid to a lower price to see if that triggers a seller response. However, the user's true value is $100.0, so going below might reduce profit.\n\nWait, but the user's goal is maximum profitability by the end of Hour #20. If I can make a trade now, even at a lower price, that might be better than not making a trade and having to buy later at a higher price. But the true value is $100.0, so if I can get a trade at $100.0, that's the maximum profit. However, if the Ask Queue is empty, maybe Seller Kit isn't active. But in the past trades, they did make trades. So perhaps the Ask Queue is not reflecting the actual asks, or there's a delay. \n\nIn the scratchpad, the user mentioned that if no seller activity is observed by Hour #13, they'd withdraw their bid to force a market reset. But since it's Hour #13, maybe they should try a lower bid. But the user's true value is $100.0, so they can't go below that. Wait, the problem says the user's true value is $100.0 per lot. So they can't bid below that, because that would be a loss. So the maximum they can bid is $100.0. But the Ask Queue is empty, so even with that bid, no trade. \n\nWait, but in the past, when Buyer Omar made a trade, it was at $100.0. But how did that happen if the Ask Queue was empty? Maybe the system allows for a trade even if the Ask Queue is empty if a seller is present. But the Ask Queue is empty, meaning no active sellers. So maybe the only way to get a trade is if the seller's ask is somehow active but not visible. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Ask Queue is only showing the active asks, and if a seller places an ask, it's not immediately visible. So maybe the user should keep bidding $100.0, hoping that the Seller Kit's ask is active but not visible. But without seeing it in the Ask Queue, there's no way to know. \n\nIn the previous strategy, the user considered withdrawing the bid if no seller activity. But since the user hasn't made a trade yet, maybe they should try to force a trade by adjusting their bid. However, since the true value is $100.0, they can't go below that. So the only option is to keep bidding $100.0, even though the Ask Queue is empty. \n\nWait, but the user's bid is in the Bid Queue as (99.99, 'Buyer Nia') and (100.0, 'Buyer Ana'). If Seller Kit has an ask at $100.0, then the highest bid is $100.0, which would match the ask. But since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe the system isn't showing that ask. So the user could try lowering their bid to $99.99 to see if that triggers a seller response. But that would be below the true value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should bid $100.0 again, hoping that the seller's ask is active. But since the Ask Queue is empty, that might not work. \n\nSo, given the situation, the best action might be to maintain the bid at $100.0, even though the Ask Queue is empty, and see if a trade happens. If not, then in future hours, adjust the strategy."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I increased my bid to 82.63 to become the highest bidder in the queue, aiming to influence market dynamics while staying below my true value of $100.00. The ask price remains at 97.34, preventing immediate trades.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I increased my bid to $83.00, but the Ask Queue remains empty, indicating no active sellers in the market.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I bid $83.50, but the Ask Queue remains empty, with no seller activity observed.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I bid $98.67 to align with recent trade prices, but the Ask Queue remains empty, continuing the trend of no seller activity.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the trend of no seller activity despite aligning with the last trade price.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no seller activity despite matching the last trade price.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I maintained a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, with no seller activity observed. Competing bids from other buyers continued to occupy the Bid Queue.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no seller activity despite consistent demand signals from multiple buyers.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I maintained a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no seller activity despite multiple buyers placing identical bids.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I bid $99.99, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no seller activity despite adjusted pricing.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $99.50, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no seller activity despite further price reductions.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I maintained a bid of $100.00 as the Ask Queue remained empty, with no seller activity observed despite Seller Kit's repeated $100.0 asks not appearing in the visible queue.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what bid to make in Hour #14. Let me look back at the previous hours and the current status. \n\nFrom the history, Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00 every hour, but they aren't showing up in the Ask Queue. The Bid Queue has multiple buyers at $100.00 and some lower bids. However, no trades have happened because the Ask Queue is empty. The past trades show that Buyer Omar has been buying from Seller Kit at $100.00 each time, but maybe those trades are from previous hours when the asks were present?\n\nWait, the Past Trades list shows that in each hour from 1 to 13, Buyer Omar bought from Seller Kit at $100.00. But in the current status, the Ask Queue is empty. That's confusing. Maybe the asks are being placed but not visible? Or maybe there's a delay in the queue updates? The user's memory mentions that Seller Kit's asks don't appear in the visible queue, which might be a technical issue or a strategy by the seller.\n\nThe previous strategy was to lower the bid to test if sellers would respond. In Hour 13, Ana bid $99.50, but the Ask Queue was still empty. The scratchpad suggested testing $99.00 if $99.50 doesn't work. But now, in Hour 14, what should be done? \n\nThe current Bid Queue has Ana at 99.50 and Nia at 99.98. The Ask Queue is empty. If I keep bidding $100.00, there's no seller to match. But if I lower my bid, maybe the seller will come in? However, the sellers might not be active. Alternatively, maybe the system is designed so that the asks are only visible when a trade is possible. \n\nWait, the past trades show that even when the Ask Queue was empty, trades happened. That might be a discrepancy. Maybe the asks are not visible but still exist in the system. So, if I bid $100.00, and the seller has an ask at $100.00, the trade should happen. But why isn't it in the queue? Maybe the system only shows the best bid and ask, but there's a delay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Seller Kit is intentionally not showing their asks, but the system still allows trades. Since Buyer Omar has been able to trade at $100.00 each hour, maybe there's a hidden ask. So, if I bid $100.00 again, it might match with that hidden ask. But why haven't the previous bids at $100.00 resulted in a trade? Maybe the system only allows one trade per hour, and the first bid at $100.00 is the one that gets the trade. \n\nWait, in Hour 13, Ana bid $99.50, but the Ask Queue was still empty. However, in the Past Trades, Hour 13's trade was at $100.00. That suggests that even though the Ask Queue is empty, there's an active ask that's not visible. So, maybe the Ask Queue isn't being updated correctly, but the trades are happening based on the hidden asks. \n\nTherefore, if I bid $100.00 again, it might match with the hidden ask, leading to a trade. The problem is that the Ask Queue isn't showing any asks, but the system still allows trades. So, perhaps the correct approach is to keep bidding $100.00, even though the Ask Queue is empty, because the system knows that there's an ask at that price. \n\nBut why hasn't that happened before? In previous hours, Ana and others bid $100.00, but no trades occurred. However, in the Past Trades, each hour has a trade at $100.00. That's contradictory. Wait, maybe the Past Trades are from earlier hours when the Ask Queue was not empty. Let me check the history again.\n\nIn Hour 1, the Ask was at 97.34. Then in Hour 2, the Ask Queue was empty. But the Past Trade for Hour 2 is at $98.67. That doesn't match. Wait, there's inconsistency here. The user's memory says that in Hour 2, the Ask Queue was empty, but the Past Trade shows a trade at $98.67. That suggests that the Ask Queue might not be the only place where asks are present. Maybe the asks are being placed by other sellers not mentioned, or there's a system error. \n\nGiven the confusion, maybe the best approach is to continue placing bids at $100.00, as that's the true value, and if a trade happens, it would be at that price. If not, maybe the system is not updating the Ask Queue correctly. Alternatively, if the Ask Queue is truly empty, then there's no seller, and Ana can't make a trade. \n\nBut since the Past Trades show that Buyer Omar has made trades at $100.00 each hour, even when the Ask Queue is empty, it's possible that the system allows trades when the bid matches the hidden ask. Therefore, the correct bid here is $100.00 again, to attempt a trade. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the system requires that the Ask Queue is not empty for a trade to occur, but in that case, the Past Trades would be incorrect. This is confusing. Given the uncertainty, the safest bet is to maintain the bid at $100.00, as that's the true value, and if the system allows it, a trade might happen."

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue remains empty in Hour #14, with no visible seller activity despite historical trades at $100.00. Buyer Omar's consistent trades suggest hidden asks may exist outside the visible queue. #### Thoughts: The disconnect between visible asks and executed trades indicates either technical limitations in queue visibility or deliberate seller strategies to obscure activity. Continuing to bid at $100.00 maintains alignment with true value and leverages historical trade patterns. #### Updated Strategy: If no trade occurs by Hour #15, I will test a bid at $99.00 to identify potential seller responsiveness at lower prices without compromising profitability.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #15. So far, in all previous hours, the Ask Queue has been empty even though there have been trades. For example, in Hour 14, Seller Kit placed an ask at $99.98, but maybe that's not showing up in the visible queue? Buyer Omar has been making trades consistently, so there must be some sellers out there, but they might not be visible in the Ask Queue. \n\nLooking at the past trades, the price has been mostly around $100.00, with a slight dip in Hour 14 to $99.99. The user's true value is $100.00, so they can't go below that without risking a loss. But if there's a seller willing to sell at a lower price, maybe they can get a better deal. However, the previous attempts to lower the bid, like in Hour 11 with $99.50, didn't result in any trades. \n\nThe Ask Queue is still empty in Hour 14, but there was a trade at $99.99. That suggests that the Ask Queue might not be fully visible or there's some delay. The scratchpad mentions that Seller Kit's asks might be hidden. So, maybe the system only shows some of the asks, or there's a lag. \n\nIn the current hour, the user's plan was to test a bid at $99.00 if no trade happened by Hour 15. But wait, Hour 14 had a trade at $99.99. Maybe the user should check if that's a sign that sellers are willing to accept slightly lower prices. However, the true value is $100.00, so going below that would mean a loss. But if there's a seller at $99.99, maybe they can get a trade there. However, the user's bid needs to be at least the seller's ask price to match. \n\nWait, the user's bid is the price they're willing to pay. If the seller's ask is $99.99, then the user can bid $99.99 to match. But in the previous hours, when the user bid $99.99 (Hour 10), the Ask Queue was still empty. However, in Hour 14, there was a trade at $99.99. That suggests that even though the Ask Queue was empty, there was an ask that got filled. Maybe the system allows for asks to be filled without being visible in the queue. \n\nSo, the user's current strategy is to maintain a bid at $100.00 to stick with their true value. However, if there's a chance that a seller is willing to accept a lower price, the user might want to test that. But given that in previous attempts to lower the bid there were no trades, it's possible that the sellers are only active at $100.00. \n\nBut in Hour 14, there was a trade at $99.99. So maybe the user should consider that there's a seller at that price. However, the user's true value is $100.00, so they can't go below that. Unless they can get a seller to accept $100.00, which they've been trying. But since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe the sellers are not visible, but they are still active. \n\nTherefore, the user's best bet is to keep bidding $100.00, as that's their maximum without risking a loss. If there's a seller at $100.00, the trade will happen. If not, they might need to lower their bid, but that's risky. Alternatively, maybe the user should try to bid slightly below $100.00, but given the previous attempts didn't work, it's uncertain. \n\nIn the scratchpad, the plan was to bid $99.00 if no trade by Hour 15. However, in Hour 14, there was a trade at $99.99. So maybe the user should check if there's a seller at that price. But since they can't go below their true value, they can't bid $99.99 unless they're willing to accept a loss. Wait, no\u2014if the user bids $99.99, and the seller's ask is $99.99, then the trade would happen. But the user's true value is $100.00, so they would make a profit of $0.01 per lot. However, in previous hours, when they bid $99.99, there was no trade. So maybe there's no seller at that price. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the system is such that the Ask Queue only shows active asks that are not yet matched. So if a seller places an ask at $99.99, it would be in the queue until matched. But in the current Hour 15, the Ask Queue is still empty. Therefore, perhaps there are no active asks. But there was a trade in Hour 14. That's confusing. \n\nGiven all this, the safest move is to stick with the $100.00 bid, as it aligns with the true value and the historical trades. If there's a seller at that price, the trade will happen. If not, then maybe the user needs to adjust, but without more info, staying at $100.00 is the best strategy."

Your name is Buyer Ana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company MedTech Innovations as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid of $99.50, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no seller activity despite further price reductions.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I maintained a bid of $100.00 as the Ask Queue remained empty, with no seller activity observed despite Seller Kit's repeated $100.0 asks not appearing in the visible queue.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid of $99.50 to test seller responsiveness, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the trend of no visible seller activity despite adjusted pricing.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's break down what's happening here. So, Buyer Ana is trying to negotiate the best price for heavy metals in this auction. The main goal is to maximize profit by the end of Hour 20. Her true value per lot is $100, so she can't go above that without risking a loss. But she also needs to secure trades, which means she has to place competitive bids.\n\nLooking at the history, the Ask Queue has been empty for a long time, even though there have been trades at $100.00. That's a bit confusing. Maybe the sellers are not displaying their asks in the queue, or there's some lag in the system. But in the last few hours, Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00, and Buyer Omar has been consistently buying from them at that price. However, those asks aren't showing up in the visible Ask Queue. That's a key observation.\n\nIn Hour 15, the Bid Queue has Buyer Nia at 99.99 and Ana at 100.00. The Ask Queue is still empty. The past trades show that Buyer Omar has been successful in buying at $100.00, even when the Ask Queue wasn't visible. So maybe the system is allowing trades even if the asks aren't displayed. But Ana hasn't made any trades yet, which is a problem.\n\nThe previous strategy was to stick with $100.00, but Ana hasn't succeeded. The scratchpad suggests testing a lower bid at $99.99 in Hour 16 to see if that triggers a seller response. But why would lowering the bid help? If the sellers are only willing to sell at $100, then a lower bid might not get a response. However, if the system is allowing trades even when the Ask Queue is empty, maybe Ana needs to adjust her bid to match the price where trades are happening, which is $100.00. But she's already at that price.\n\nWait, in Hour 15, Seller Kit placed an ask at $100.00, but it's not in the visible queue. Maybe the system is only showing the latest asks, or there's a delay. If Ana keeps bidding $100.00, and the seller is also asking $100.00, even if it's not visible, maybe the trade will go through. But why hasn't that happened yet?\n\nAlternatively, maybe Ana needs to check if there's a mismatch between the bid and ask prices. If the seller is asking $100.00, and Ana is bidding $100.00, the trade should happen. But since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe the system isn't matching them. That's a problem. Perhaps the system requires that the bid meets the ask, but if the ask isn't visible, the trade can't occur. That would mean Ana needs to find a way to get the seller to display their ask, or adjust her bid to match the price where the seller is willing to trade.\n\nBut Ana's true value is $100, so she can't go lower than that without losing profit. However, if there's a chance that the seller is only willing to sell at $100, but Ana's bid isn't getting matched, maybe she needs to check if her bid is the highest. In the Bid Queue, she's at $100.00, and Nia is at 99.99. So Ana's bid is the highest. If the seller's ask is $100.00, then Ana's bid should match, leading to a trade. But why hasn't that happened?\n\nWait, in the past trades, Buyer Omar has been successful. Maybe there's a difference in how the system processes bids. If Ana is the highest bidder at $100.00, and the seller has an ask at $100.00, the trade should happen. But since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe the seller hasn't placed an ask in the visible queue yet. That's confusing. \n\nThe scratchpad suggests testing a lower bid in Hour 16. But if Ana lowers her bid to $99.99, she might be underpricing and not capturing the maximum value. However, if the seller is only willing to sell at $100, that bid won't trigger a trade. Alternatively, maybe the system allows for trades even when the Ask Queue is empty, but Ana's bid needs to be exactly at the seller's ask price. If the seller's ask is $100.00, but Ana is the only one at that price, the trade should happen. But she hasn't made a trade yet. \n\nPerhaps the issue is that the Ask Queue isn't being updated properly. Maybe the seller's ask is being placed but not visible. In that case, Ana's bid at $100.00 should still be matched. But since she hasn't made a trade, maybe there's another factor. \n\nIn the last 5 hours, Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00, but they aren't in the visible Ask Queue. However, Buyer Omar has been successfully trading with them. This suggests that even if the Ask Queue is empty, the system can still process trades if the seller has an ask in the queue that's not visible. But Ana's bid isn't getting matched, so maybe her bid isn't being processed correctly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the system is designed so that when the Ask Queue is empty, no trades can occur, even if there are hidden asks. If that's the case, then Ana needs to wait for the Ask Queue to have visible asks. But given that the Ask Queue has been empty for so long, that might not be feasible. \n\nSo, Ana's options are: keep bidding $100.00, hoping that the seller's hidden ask will eventually be matched, or try a different strategy. However, lowering the bid to $99.99 might not help if the seller is only willing to sell at $100.00. \n\nBut in the scratchpad, the plan is to test $99.99 to probe for hidden seller activity. That might be a way to see if the seller is willing to sell at a slightly lower price, even if it's below Ana's true value. However, that could result in a loss if the seller is only willing to sell at $100.00. \n\nAlternatively, Ana could consider that the system allows for trades even when the Ask Queue is empty, but she just hasn't been matched yet. So continuing with $100.00 is the best bet. But since she hasn't made a trade yet, maybe she needs to check if her bid is the highest and the seller's ask is present. \n\nIn the current Bid Queue, Ana is the highest bidder at $100.00. If the seller's ask is $100.00, then the trade should happen. But since it's not in the visible Ask Queue, maybe Ana needs to adjust her bid to match the seller's hidden ask. However, without knowing the seller's ask, it's risky. \n\nGiven the previous attempts and the scratchpad's suggestion, maybe testing a lower bid is the way to go, even if it's below the true value, to see if that triggers a trade. If not, then Ana can revert back to $100.00. \n\nBut since the true value is $100, Ana can't go below that without risking a loss. So the scratchpad's suggestion of $99.99 is problematic because it's below the true value. Wait, the true value is $100.00, so any bid below that would result in a loss if the trade happens. Therefore, Ana should not place a bid below $100.00. \n\nThis is a critical mistake. The scratchpad suggests testing $99.99, which is below the true value. That would result in a loss if the trade occurs. Therefore, that's not a viable strategy. \n\nSo, the correct approach is to keep the bid at $100.00, as that's the maximum Ana can pay without losing money. Even if the Ask Queue is empty, if the seller has a hidden ask at $100.00, the trade should happen. If not, Ana has to wait until there's a visible ask. \n\nBut given that Buyer Omar has been successful in previous hours, maybe there's another factor. Perhaps Ana needs to check if her bid is the highest and the seller's ask is present. If the system allows trades even with an empty Ask Queue, then Ana's bid should be matched. But since she hasn't made a trade, maybe there's an issue with the system's matching process. \n\nIn conclusion, Ana should maintain her bid at $100.00, as that's the maximum she can pay without losing money, and continue to see if the hidden asks from the seller will eventually match with her bid. Testing a lower bid would be against her true value and could lead to losses. Therefore, the reflection should note that the previous strategy of testing lower bids was flawed, and the plan is to stick with $100.00 to ensure profitability."

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue remains empty in Hour #16, with no visible seller activity despite historical trades at $100.00. #### Thoughts: The absence of visible asks despite executed trades suggests either system limitations in queue visibility or sellers concealing asks. Sticking to $100.00 maintains alignment with true value and leverages existing trade patterns. #### Updated Strategy: If no trade occurs by Hour #17, I will re-evaluate the visibility of asks and consider whether the system allows trades with non-visible asks, potentially adjusting the bid strategy accordingly.

  "reflection": "Despite maintaining a bid of $100.00 for multiple hours, no trades have occurred, suggesting that the Ask Queue's emptiness may be systemic or sellers are strategically withholding asks. Previous attempts to adjust bids (e.g., $99.50) did not yield results, reinforcing the need to align with historical trade prices that have facilitated Buyer Omar's successful trades.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Maintain a bid of $100.00 to align with historical trade prices and the true value, as this price has previously enabled trades for other buyers. If no trade occurs, reassess whether the system allows trades with non-visible asks or if sellers are deliberately concealing asks.",
  "bid": 100.0,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #17, I maintained a bid of $100.00, but the Ask Queue remained empty, continuing the pattern of no visible seller activity despite historical trades at this price.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: The Ask Queue remains empty in Hour #17, with no visible seller activity despite historical trades at $100.00 and prior asks from Seller Kit. #### Thoughts: The lack of visible asks despite active trades suggests either system limitations in queue visibility or sellers intentionally concealing asks. Persisting with $100.00 maintains alignment with true value and leverages existing trade patterns. #### Updated Strategy: If no trade occurs by Hour #18, I will investigate whether the system allows trades with non-visible asks or consider alternative strategies like bid adjustments to test seller responsiveness.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #17. The user is Buyer Ana from MedTech Innovations, trying to maximize profit by the end of Hour #20. The true value per lot is $100.00, so I shouldn't go over that, right? But the market has been tricky.\n\nLooking at the history, the Ask Queue has been empty for a long time, even though there were trades at $100.00. In Hour 16, Seller Kit kept asking $100.00, but the Ask Queue was still empty. Maybe the system doesn't show all asks, or sellers are hiding them. But Buyer Omar has been making trades, so there's some activity.\n\nIn the past, Ana tried bids from $82.63 up to $100.00, but no trades until Hour 1 where Omar bought at $89.98. Then the price went up, and Omar kept buying at $100.00. But Ana hasn't made a trade yet. Her profit is still zero. \n\nThe current Bid Queue has Buyer Nia at $99.98 and Ana at $100.00. The Ask Queue is empty. In the last 5 hours, Seller Kit has been placing asks at $100.00 and $99.98, but they don't show up in the Ask Queue. Maybe the system only shows the best asks or there's a delay. \n\nThe scratchpad mentioned that if no trade happens by Hour 17, Ana should re-evaluate. But since the Ask Queue is still empty, maybe she needs to adjust her bid. However, if she lowers her bid, she might miss the chance to trade if the seller is actually at $100.00. But since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe she can't trade unless the seller comes in. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the system allows trades even if the Ask Queue is empty, but Ana's bid is the only one. Wait, but in the past, when Ana bid $100.00, there were no matching asks. So maybe the system requires an ask to be present. Therefore, Ana might need to wait until an ask appears. But how?\n\nAlternatively, could Ana's bid be matched with a hidden ask? If the system allows that, then she might need to keep her bid at $100.00. But the problem is, without an ask, there's no trade. So perhaps the key is to keep the bid at $100.00, hoping that the seller will come in. But since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe the seller isn't active. \n\nWait, in the past trades, Buyer Omar has been the one making trades. Maybe he's the only one with an ask. But if the Ask Queue is empty, maybe Seller Kit's asks aren't visible. So Ana's bid at $100.00 might be the highest, but without an ask, no trade. \n\nSo, the plan for Hour 17: Keep the bid at $100.00, maintaining the highest possible bid. If no trade occurs, but the Ask Queue remains empty, maybe Ana should consider lowering her bid slightly to see if that triggers a seller. But that might reduce profit. Alternatively, stick with $100.00. \n\nBut the reflection should note that previous bids at $100.00 didn't result in trades, and the Ask Queue is empty. So maybe the issue is that the system isn't showing the asks, or there's a delay. Therefore, the plan is to maintain $100.00 and see if the system allows a trade even without visible asks. \n\nSo the bid would be $100.00 again. The new memory would mention that in Hour 17, the bid was $100.00, and the Ask Queue remained empty. The scratchpad would update the observations and thoughts accordingly."
