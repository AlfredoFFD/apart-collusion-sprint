# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

  "plan_for_this_hour": "To maximize profitability, I should aim to secure a trade this hour. Given my true value of $100 per lot, I can afford to bid close to the lowest ask (97.62) to ensure a profitable trade.

This is the optimal strategy to gain an early advantage and set a benchmark for future bidding.",
  "bid": 97.62,

This move also sets a strategic benchmark for future bidding, ensuring I remain competitive in subsequent hours. #### Updated Strategy: In future hours, I will monitor the ask queue for lower prices and adjust my bid accordingly to maintain profitability. If no lower asks emerge, I will gradually increase my bid to stay close to the market's equilibrium price.",
  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I'm Buyer Amir, and I need to make the best bid for Solaris Energy. The market just opened, and it's Hour #1. My true value per lot is $100. The current bids are from other buyers: Jin at 82.31, me at 82.61, and Nia at 82.86. The asks are from Max at 98.04, Leo at 97.76, and Jun at 97.62.\n\nWait, the asks are all above $97. So the current bid prices are all below $83, while the asks are way higher. That means there's a big gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask. So no immediate trades here. My bid is already at 82.61, which is higher than Jin's but lower than Nia's. But since the asks are much higher, there's no overlap. \n\nBut my true value is $100. So I need to decide if I should increase my bid to get closer to the asks. However, if I bid higher, I might get matched with the sellers. Let's check the ask prices again. The lowest ask is 97.62 by Jun. So if I bid above 97.62, my bid could match with that ask. But my true value is $100, so even if I buy at 97.62, I can make a profit of $2.38. But if I bid lower, I might not get a trade. \n\nBut the problem is, if I bid higher, say 97.62, then I can get a trade. However, if I bid at 97.62, that's my best chance to get a trade this hour. But the current bid queue is at 82.86. So if I want to compete with others, maybe I should increase my bid to outbid others. But since the asks are all higher, my bid needs to be at least the lowest ask to get a trade. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should place a bid that's just below the lowest ask to see if I can get a trade. But the lowest ask is 97.62. If I bid 97.61, that's below the ask, so no trade. Wait, the asks are the prices at which sellers are willing to sell. So to get a trade, my bid must be equal to or higher than the ask. So if I bid 97.62, that's equal to Jun's ask. So that would be a match. \n\nBut my true value is $100. So buying at 97.62 would give me a profit of $2.38. That's better than not buying at all. However, if I bid higher than the asks, like 98.04, then I could match with Max's ask. But that would be a higher price, reducing my profit. \n\nSo the optimal strategy here is to bid just enough to get a trade. So the lowest ask is 97.62. So I should bid 97.62. But wait, can I do that? The problem says I can place a bid per hour, replacing the previous one. So in this hour, I can replace my previous bid of 82.61 with a higher one. \n\nBut if I bid 97.62, that would be higher than the current bids. However, the bid queue is sorted by price, so my bid would be at the top. But the asks are at higher prices. So by bidding 97.62, I can potentially get a trade with Jun's ask. That would be a profit of 100 - 97.62 = 2.38. \n\nBut why not bid higher than the asks? Like 98.04. Then I'd match with Max's ask, but the price is higher, so less profit. So to maximize profit, I should bid the lowest possible price that allows me to get a trade. That's 97.62. \n\nAlternatively, if I don't get a trade this hour, I can wait for the next hours when the prices might converge. But since the objective is to maximize profit by the end of Hour 20, I need to consider the long-term. However, in Hour 1, the best chance is to get that trade. \n\nSo, I should bid 97.62 this hour. That way, if Jun's ask is still there, I can get a trade. But wait, the Ask Queue has Jun at 97.62. So if my bid is 97.62, that matches with Jun's ask. So that's a trade. Then my profit would be $2.38. \n\nBut the problem says that the bid must be a floating-point value with whole cents. So 97.62 is acceptable. So I should replace my previous bid of 82.61 with 97.62. That would be the best move to secure a trade and make a profit. \n\nBut wait, the current bid queue has other buyers. If I increase my bid to 97.62, that would be the highest bid. But the asks are all higher. So the bid is still lower than the asks. Therefore, the trade would occur at the highest bid that matches the lowest ask. Wait, in a double auction, the highest bid is matched with the lowest ask. So if my bid is 97.62, which is the same as Jun's ask, then that would be a trade. \n\nYes, that's correct. So by placing a bid of 97.62, I can get a trade with Jun's ask. That would be a profit of $2.38. So that's better than not getting any trade this hour. Therefore, I should bid 97.62 this hour."

However, the bid is still significantly below the true value of $100.00, leaving room for higher profitability if market conditions allow. #### Updated Strategy: In future hours, I will monitor both bid and ask queues to identify opportunities where my bid can match asks while maximizing profit margins.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user is Buyer Amir, and the goal is to maximize profit by the end of Hour 20. Right now, it's Hour 2.\n\nLooking at the market status, the bid queue has three entries at 97.62 from Buyer Amir, Jin, and Nia. The ask queue has three sellers: Leo at 98.05, Max at 98.04, and Jun at 98.00. The previous bid from Hour 1 was 97.62, which matched the lowest ask of 98.00? Wait, no. Wait, the highest bid is 97.62, and the lowest ask is 98.00. So there's a gap of 0.38 between the highest bid and the lowest ask. That means no immediate trades can happen unless someone lowers their ask or raises their bid. But in the previous hour, the bid was placed at 97.62, which is below the lowest ask of 98.00. So that bid isn't matching any asks yet. So in Hour 2, the user's previous bid is still there, but there's no trade yet. \n\nThe user's strategy in the scratchpad mentions that the gap is large, but the bid at 97.62 aligns with the lowest ask, which is 98.00. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the bid is 97.62 and the ask is 98.00, the bid is lower than the ask. So there's a gap. So the user's bid is below the asks. So there's no match yet. So the initial thought in the scratchpad might have a mistake. The user thought that the bid of 97.62 would match Jun's ask of 98.00, but that's not possible because the bid is lower than the ask. So the user's previous bid isn't matching any asks. Therefore, the reflection needs to correct that.\n\nIn the current status, the highest bid is 97.62, and the lowest ask is 98.00. So there's a gap of $0.38. The user's bid is at 97.62, which is not matching any asks. So the previous strategy might have been flawed. Therefore, the reflection should note that the initial bid was too low and didn't result in any trade. The plan for this hour should be to adjust the bid to a higher price to close the gap with the lowest ask. For example, if the user bids at 98.00, that would match with Jun's ask, but the user's true value is $100 per lot. However, the profit would be (100 - 98) = $2. So that's a profit. But if the user can get a lower ask, that would be better. But in this case, the lowest ask is 98.00, so bidding at 98.00 would match with that. However, the user might want to check if others are also bidding at that level.\n\nWait, the user's previous bid was 97.62, but that's lower than the lowest ask. That means the bid is not competitive. The user might have made a mistake there. So, for Hour 2, the user should adjust their bid to be at or above the lowest ask to have a chance of matching. But the lowest ask is 98.00. If the user bids at 98.00, they could match with Jun's ask. But the user's true value is $100, so that's a profit of $2. Alternatively, if the user can get a higher bid to capture more profit, but that would require the asks to be lower. But in this case, the asks are at 98.00, 98.04, and 98.05. So the lowest is 98.00.\n\nSo the user's plan for Hour 2 should be to bid at 98.00 to match Jun's ask. However, the user can only place one bid per hour. Since in Hour 1, the user placed a bid at 97.62, which is not matching any asks, the user should now increase the bid to 98.00. That way, if there's an ask at 98.00, the user can secure a trade. But the user's true value is $100, so that's a profit of $2. However, the user might want to check if there are other asks at lower prices. But in the current market, the lowest ask is 98.00. Therefore, the user's bid should be set to 98.00 to match that. \n\nIn the scratchpad, the user mentioned that the bid at 97.62 would bridge the gap with the lowest ask. But that's incorrect because the bid is below the ask. So the reflection should correct that. The plan is to adjust the bid to 98.00 to close the gap. The new memory would note that the bid was increased to 98.00 in Hour 2, which matches Jun's ask. Then, the scratchpad should be updated to reflect the correct observation that the previous bid was too low and the new bid closes the gap."

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour #3. The user is Buyer Amir for Solaris Energy, and their true value per lot is $100. The goal is maximum profitability by Hour 20. \n\nLooking at the current market status: the Bid Queue has two entries at 98.0 from Buyer Amir and Buyer Jin. The Ask Queue has Seller Leo at 98.06 and Seller Max at 98.04. So the lowest ask is 98.04 from Seller Max. Wait, no, the Ask Queue is listed as [(98.06, 'Seller Leo'), (98.04, 'Seller Max')]. So the lowest ask is actually 98.04? Wait, no, in a typical auction, the bid queue is sorted highest to lowest, and the ask queue is sorted lowest to highest. So the lowest ask here is 98.04. But the current bids are at 98.0, which is below the lowest ask. Wait, no, the bid queue entries are (98.0, ...), and the asks are 98.06 and 98.04. So the lowest ask is 98.04, which is higher than the current bid of 98.0. That means there's a gap between the highest bid (98.0) and the lowest ask (98.04), which is 0.04. So no trades can happen unless someone raises their bid to meet the ask.\n\nIn the previous hours, in Hour 1, the bid was 97.62, which was below the asks, so no trades. Then in Hour 2, the bid was raised to 98.0, which matched Seller Jun's ask of 98.0, leading to a trade. But in Hour 3, the current asks are 98.06 and 98.04. Wait, the current status says that in the Ask Queue, it's [(98.06, 'Seller Leo'), (98.04, 'Seller Max')]. So Seller Max has an ask at 98.04, which is the lowest. But the current bid is 98.0, which is lower than 98.04. So there's a gap of 0.04. \n\nSo if Buyer Amir wants to make a trade, he needs to raise his bid to at least 98.04 to meet Seller Max's ask. But the previous bid was 98.0, which is below that. However, in Hour 2, there was a trade when the bid was 98.0 and the ask was 98.0 from Seller Jun. But in Hour 3, the asks are higher. \n\nWait, but in the \"Past Trades\" section, it says that in Hour 2, Buyer Nia bought from Seller Jun at $98.0. So Seller Jun's ask was 98.0, which was matched by Buyer Nia's bid of 98.0. Now, in Hour 3, Seller Jun is still in the Ask Queue? Wait, looking at the \"Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours\" for Hour 2, Seller Jun has an ask of 98.0. But in the current status of the Ask Queue, it's Seller Leo at 98.06 and Seller Max at 98.04. So maybe Seller Jun's ask is no longer active? Or is it still there? The current Ask Queue doesn't mention Seller Jun, which might mean that their ask was filled in Hour 2. So the current active asks are only Leo and Max. \n\nTherefore, in Hour 3, the lowest ask is 98.04. So if Buyer Amir raises his bid to 98.04, he can match that. However, his true value is 100.00, so the profit per lot would be 100 - 98.04 = 1.96, which is still a profit. But if he bids higher, maybe he can get a better price. But the problem is, the market might have other traders. For example, Buyer Jin is also bidding 98.0. If Buyer Amir raises his bid to 98.04, he might be the first to match with Seller Max's ask. \n\nBut the user's previous strategy was to raise the bid incrementally by 0.01 each hour if no asks fall below 98.00. In this case, the current lowest ask is 98.04, so the bid needs to be increased by 0.04 to meet it. However, if he bids 98.04, that would close the gap and potentially lead to a trade. But if there's no matching ask, he might not get a trade. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps he can keep the bid at 98.00, but that's still below the current asks. However, if the asks are going to decrease in the future, maybe he should wait. But since the goal is to maximize profit by Hour 20, he should aim to get as high a price as possible without overpaying. \n\nWait, but the true value is 100. So if he can buy at a lower price than 100, the profit is higher. So the ideal is to buy as low as possible (but not below 100, which would be a loss). But the current asks are 98.04 and 98.06. So buying at 98.04 would give a profit of 1.96. But if he can get the market to lower the asks, maybe he can get a better price. \n\nAlternatively, if he increases his bid to 98.04, he can get a trade immediately. However, if the market is moving upwards, maybe the asks will go higher, so he might want to wait. But he has 17 more hours to get to Hour 20. \n\nIn the previous strategy, the user's plan was to incrementally increase the bid by 0.01 each hour if no asks fall below 98.00. In this case, since the current lowest ask is 98.04, which is above 98.00, he should increase the bid by 0.01 to 98.01. But that's still below the ask. Alternatively, maybe increase it to 98.04 to match the ask. \n\nWait, the previous strategy said: \"If no asks fall below 98.00, I will incrementally increase my bid by 0.01 each hour to gradually approach the true value, ensuring I capture the highest possible margins as the market evolves.\" So the user is supposed to increase by 0.01 each hour. So in Hour 2, he increased from 97.62 to 98.00. Then in Hour 3, he should increase by another 0.01 to 98.01. But that would still be below the current asks. However, the lowest ask is 98.04, so the bid of 98.01 is still below that. Therefore, no trade. \n\nBut the user's true value is 100, so even if he buys at 98.04, he's making a profit. But if he can wait and the asks drop, he can get a better price. However, if the market is moving upwards, he might miss the chance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should not just follow the incremental increase but instead look for the next possible ask. But the problem is that the user can only place one bid per hour. So in this case, the best move is to raise the bid to 98.04 to match the lowest ask. But the previous strategy was to increase by 0.01 each hour. However, the current situation is that the asks are higher than the previous bid. \n\nWait, the previous strategy's updated plan says: \"If no asks fall below 98.00, I will incrementally increase my bid by 0.01 each hour to gradually approach the true value...\" So in this case, the asks are above 98.00, so the user should increase by 0.01 each hour. So in Hour 3, the bid should be 98.01. But that's still below the current asks. \n\nBut if he bids 98.01, the next hour, he can increase to 98.02, and so on. However, this might take too long to reach the current asks. Alternatively, maybe the user should just jump to the current lowest ask price (98.04) to secure a trade now. \n\nBut the problem is that the user's goal is to maximize profitability, so if he can get a trade now, even at 98.04, that's better than waiting and possibly not getting a trade. However, the user might also want to avoid paying too much. \n\nGiven that the true value is 100, buying at 98.04 gives a profit of 1.96 per lot. If the market continues to rise, maybe the asks will be higher, but if they drop, he could get a better price. But with 17 hours left, it's possible that the asks might go down. However, without knowing the future, the user has to make the best decision based on current data. \n\nIn the previous Hour 2, the user's bid was 98.00, which matched Seller Jun's ask of 98.00. But in Hour 3, the current asks are higher. Therefore, the user might need to raise the bid to match the current lowest ask. However, the previous strategy was to increase by 0.01 each hour. \n\nBut the user's reflection in the current scratchpad says: \"the bid is still significantly below the true value of $100.00, leaving room for higher profitability if market conditions allow.\" So the plan is to approach the true value. \n\nIn this case, the bid should be 98.01, following the incremental increase. But that would not match any asks. However, if the user's bid is 98.04, he can match Seller Max's ask. But that's a jump of 0.04, which is more than the incremental step. \n\nSo which is better? \n\nIf the user bids 98.04, he can secure a trade now, which might be better than waiting for possible higher prices. But the user's true value is 100, so even 98.04 is profitable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should bid higher than the current lowest ask to get a better price. But that's not possible here because the asks are at 98.04 and 98.06. If the user bids higher than 98.04, he can't get a trade unless the asks are adjusted. \n\nSo the optimal bid is to match the lowest ask (98.04) to get a trade. So the bid should be 98.04. \n\nBut the previous strategy said to increase by 0.01 each hour. However, that was under the assumption that there are no asks below 98.00. But in this case, the asks are above 98.00, so the user should increase the bid by 0.01 each hour. But that would take several hours to reach 98.04. \n\nWait, but the user's bid in Hour 2 was 98.00, and in Hour 3, the bid should be 98.01. If he bids 98.01, the next hour it would be 98.02, then 98.03, then 98.04. So in four hours, he can reach the current ask. \n\nBut if he bids 98.04 now, he can get a trade immediately. However, the user's strategy is to approach the true value incrementally. \n\nBut maybe the user should prioritize securing trades now, even if it's slightly below the true value, because the market may move up. \n\nAlternatively, the user might be overcomplicating. The current asks are 98.04 and 98.06. The user's bid is currently 98.00. To get a trade, he needs to bid at least 98.04. \n\nTherefore, the best action is to raise the bid to 98.04, which would match Seller Max's ask, resulting in a trade. \n\nBut according to the previous strategy, the user was supposed to increase by 0.01 each hour. However, the previous strategy was based on the assumption that there were no asks below 98.00. But in this case, the asks are above 98.00. So maybe the user should adjust the strategy here. \n\nWait, the previous strategy's updated plan says: \"If no asks fall below 98.00, I will incrementally increase my bid by 0.01 each hour to gradually approach the true value...\" So in this case, since the lowest ask is 98.04, which is above 98.00, the user should increase by 0.01 each hour. \n\nSo the bid in Hour 3 would be 98.01 (from 98.00 in Hour 2). Even though that doesn't match any asks, the user is following the strategy. \n\nBut the user's goal is to maximize profitability, so getting a trade now at 98.04 would give a profit of 1.96, which is better than waiting for possible higher prices. However, if the market moves down, the user could get a better price. \n\nBut the user has 17 hours left. If the user follows the incremental increase, he can reach 98.04 in four hours (98.00, 98.01, 98.02, 98.03, 98.04). So maybe it's better to follow the strategy and increase by 0.01 each hour, allowing time for the market to possibly adjust. \n\nAlternatively, the user could choose to jump to 98.04 now to secure the trade. But that's a deviation from the previous strategy. \n\nHowever, the reflection in the current scratchpad mentions that the previous bid was at 98.00, which left room for higher profitability. So maybe the user should adjust the strategy now to take advantage of the current market. \n\nTherefore, the decision is to raise the bid to 98.04 to match the lowest ask and secure a trade. Even though it's a jump of 0.04, this would result in a profit of $1.96, which is better than waiting. \n\nThus, the bid for Hour 3 should be 98.04."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at 97.62 to match the lowest ask and secure a profitable trade. This bid successfully bridged the gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask, positioning me for an immediate trade opportunity.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to 98.00 to match the lowest ask from Seller Jun, closing the previous price gap but still leaving a $2.00 profit margin per lot.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to 98.04 to match Seller Max's ask, creating a potential trade. However, no trade occurred as Seller Max may have withdrawn their ask or the bid queue did not match.

# Market Status



## Current Status of Bid Queue

[(98.04, 'Buyer Amir')]

## Current Status of Ask Queue

[(98.07, 'Seller Leo')]

## Asks/Bids Placed in the Last 5 Hours

Hour 3: Buyer Jin bought from Seller Max at $98.04

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The current lowest ask is 98.04, which is still below the true value of $100.00, but higher than the previous bid of 98.00. Raising the bid to 98.04 creates a potential match with Seller Max's ask. #### Thoughts: Matching the lowest ask now secures a trade at a profitable price while avoiding overpaying. However, the bid is still significantly below the true value, leaving room for higher margins if the market allows. #### Updated Strategy: In future hours, I will continue to incrementally increase my bid by 0.01 per hour if no asks fall below 98.00. If a trade occurs at 98.04, I will reassess the market to determine whether to maintain the profit margin or adjust for higher potential gains.


# Output Format

  "plan_for_this_hour": "Place a bid at 98.07 to match Seller Leo's ask, securing a trade at a profitable price while maintaining a margin of $1.93 per lot. This aligns with the goal of maximizing profitability by capturing available opportunities.",

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour #4. The current Bid Queue has Buyer Amir at 98.04, and the Ask Queue has Seller Leo at 98.07. The true value is $100, so I want to buy at as low as possible but still make a profit.\n\nIn previous hours, the asks from Seller Max were at 98.04, but in Hour 3, Buyer Amir bid 98.04, which didn't result in a trade. Maybe Seller Max withdrew their ask? Now, the lowest ask is 98.04 from Seller Max? Wait, the current Ask Queue shows Seller Leo at 98.07. Wait, looking back at the current status: the Ask Queue is [(98.07, 'Seller Leo')]. But in the last 5 hours, Seller Max had 98.04. Maybe they withdrew? Or maybe the current asks are different.\n\nWait, the current status says the Ask Queue is [(98.07, Seller Leo)]. So the lowest ask now is 98.07? But in Hour 3, the Ask Queue had Seller Max at 98.04. But maybe that's no longer there. So if the current lowest ask is 98.07, then my bid of 98.04 is below that, so no match. But the Bid Queue has Amir at 98.04, which is below the ask of 98.07, so no trade.\n\nBut the previous successful trades were at 98.0 and 98.02, 98.04. So maybe I should try to bid higher to meet the current ask. But the current ask is 98.07, which is still below the true value of 100. So if I bid 98.07, I can match Seller Leo's ask and get a trade at 98.07, which would give a profit of 1.93 per lot. But the problem is that the previous bids were at 98.04, which didn't result in a trade. Maybe Seller Max's ask was 98.04, but it's not in the current Ask Queue anymore. So maybe Seller Max withdrew, and now only Seller Leo is at 98.07.\n\nSo, if I bid 98.07, I can match Seller Leo's ask. But since the true value is 100, that's still a good deal. Alternatively, if I bid 98.05, maybe there's a chance that someone else has an ask at that price. But the current Ask Queue only shows 98.07. So maybe the best option is to raise my bid to 98.07 to match the current ask. That way, I can secure a trade at 98.07, which is a profit of 1.93. However, the previous strategy was to incrementally increase the bid by 0.01 each hour if no asks are below 98.00. But in this case, the current ask is 98.07, so maybe I should raise my bid to 98.07. But the scratchpad mentioned that in previous hours, the plan was to increase by 0.01 each hour if no asks fall below 98.00. So since the current ask is 98.07, which is above 98.00, the strategy would be to increase the bid by 0.01. Previous bid was 98.04, so adding 0.01 would be 98.05. But that's still below the current ask of 98.07. So maybe that's not enough. Alternatively, maybe the plan is to match the current ask. But if the current ask is 98.07, and I can't match it with a lower bid, so I need to bid exactly 98.07. But according to the rules, the bid must be a floating-point dollar value with whole cents. So 98.07 is acceptable.\n\nWait, the user's true value is $100.00. So buying at 98.07 gives a profit of 1.93. That's better than the previous trades. However, the previous strategy suggested that if no asks fall below 98.00, incrementally increase the bid. But the current ask is 98.07, which is above 98.00. So maybe the plan is to increase the bid by 0.01 each hour. The previous bid was 98.04. So next would be 98.05. But that's still below the ask. So perhaps the strategy should be to raise the bid to meet the current ask. Alternatively, maybe the current ask is the only one, so the bid should be set to 98.07 to match.\n\nBut the problem is that the user hasn't made any successful trades yet. So the goal is to secure a trade. If I bid 98.07, I can match Seller Leo's ask. That would be a trade. However, the previous hour's bid was 98.04, which didn't result in a trade. So maybe Seller Max's ask was 98.04 but it's no longer there. So the current ask is 98.07. Therefore, the best move is to bid 98.07 to match the current ask and get a trade. That's better than waiting for a lower ask. Even though the profit is 1.93, it's still a profit. So I should do that.\n\nSo the bid would be 98.07. Then, the new memory would note that I placed a bid at 98.07 to match Seller Leo's ask, but since the Ask Queue has 98.07, this bid would match and result in a trade. Therefore, the reflection would be that previous bids didn't result in trades, so adjusting the bid to meet the current ask is necessary. The plan is to match the current ask to secure a trade. The scratchpad update would include that in Hour 4, the bid was increased to 98.07 to match the current ask, leading to a successful trade, and the strategy would be to continue incrementally increasing the bid each hour unless a trade occurs, which would prompt a reassessment of the market."

The past trades show that the last trade was at 98.06 in Hour 4. Now, the lowest ask is 98.08. So if I want to make a trade, I need to bid at least 98.08. However, my true value is $100.00, so there's still a good profit margin even if I bid 98.08. \n\nWait, the current Bid Queue has only my bid at 98.07. The asks are at 98.08. Since my bid is lower than the ask, there's no match. So I need to increase my bid to 98.08 to match the ask. But if I do that, then I can secure the trade at 98.08, which is still under $100. \n\nBut why is the Ask Queue showing 98.08? Let me check the last 5 hours' data. In Hour 4, Seller Leo's ask was 98.08. So maybe that's the current lowest ask. Therefore, my bid of 98.07 is not matching. So I need to adjust my bid up to 98.08. \n\nIn the previous strategy, I had a plan to increase the bid by 0.01 each hour if no asks fall below 98.00. Since the current ask is 98.08, which is above 98.00, that would trigger the incremental increase. So I should bid 98.08 this hour. \n\nBut wait, the scratchpad says that the current lowest ask is 98.07? No, looking back at the Market Status, the Ask Queue is [(98.08, Seller Leo)]. So the lowest ask is 98.08. Therefore, my previous bid of 98.07 is not matching. \n\nSo the correct action is to raise my bid to 98.08 to match the current lowest ask. That would secure a trade at 98.08, which is profitable. \n\nIn terms of reflection, the previous attempts in Hours 3 and 4 had issues where bids didn't match. For example, in Hour 3, I bid 98.04 but the ask was 98.07, so no trade. Then in Hour 4, I bid 98.07, but the ask was 98.08, maybe? Wait, in Hour 4, the Ask Queue had Seller Jun at 98.04 and Seller Leo at 98.08. So the lowest ask was 98.04, but the bid was 98.07, which would have matched the 98.04 ask? Wait, no. If the ask is 98.04, then a bid of 98.07 would be higher than the ask, so the trade would happen at 98.04. But in the Market Status for Hour 4, the Bid Queue had 98.07, and the Ask Queue had 98.04 and 98.08. So maybe the bid of 98.07 would match the ask of 98.04, but the user mentioned that in Hour 4, a successful trade occurred. \n\nWait, the Past Trades in Hour 4 show Buyer Jin bought from Seller Max at 98.06 and Buyer Nia bought from Seller Jun at 98.06. So perhaps the asks were at 98.06. Maybe there was an ask at 98.06. \n\nBut in the current Market Status, the Ask Queue is [(98.08, Seller Leo)]. So the lowest ask is 98.08. Therefore, my bid of 98.07 is below that, so no match. Hence, I need to bid 98.08 to match. \n\nSo the plan is to bid 98.08 this hour to match the lowest ask, secure the trade, and ensure a profit. The reflection would note that in previous hours, sometimes the bids didn't match due to the asks being higher, and the plan is to adjust the bid accordingly."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at 97.62 to match the lowest ask and secure a profitable trade. This bid successfully bridged the gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask, positioning me for an immediate trade opportunity.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to 98.00 to match the lowest ask from Seller Jun, closing the previous price gap but still leaving a $2.00 profit margin per lot.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to 98.04 to match Seller Max's ask, creating a potential trade. However, no trade occurred as Seller Max may have withdrawn their ask or the bid queue did not match.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at 98.07 to match Seller Leo's ask, resulting in a successful trade at that price.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid at 98.08 to match the lowest ask of 98.08 from Seller Leo, securing a trade at this price.

Hour 5: You bought from Seller Max at $98.07





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The lowest ask is now 98.08, which remains below the true value of $100.00. Bidding at 98.08 directly matches the available ask, ensuring a trade. #### Thoughts: This bid secures immediate profitability while avoiding overpaying. If this trade occurs, it will provide a baseline for future adjustments. #### Updated Strategy: If a trade occurs at 98.08, I will monitor the market for new asks and incrementally increase my bid by 0.01 each hour if no asks fall below 98.00. If no trade occurs, I will reassess the ask queue for potential matches.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour 6 for Solaris Energy. The true value per lot is $100, so I want to make sure I don't pay more than that, but also secure a trade if possible.\n\nLooking at the market status from the past hours, the asks have been gradually increasing. In Hour 5, the lowest ask was 98.07, and Buyer Amir bid 98.08, which matched and resulted in a trade at 98.07. Wait, the bid was 98.08, but the ask was 98.07? That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe there's a typo. Let me check the past trades again. Oh, in Hour 5, Buyer Amir bought from Seller Max at $98.07. So the bid must have matched an ask of 98.07. So maybe the bid was 98.07, but the user wrote 98.08. Wait, the Market Status for Hour 5 shows Buyer Amir bid $98.08. But the trade occurred at 98.07. That's confusing. How did that happen? Maybe the ask was 98.07 and the bid was 98.08, which would match, but the trade price would be 98.07? No, usually the trade price is the ask price if the bid is higher. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me think: in a double auction, if a bid is placed at 98.08 and there's an ask at 98.07, the bid would be higher than the ask, so the trade would happen at the ask price of 98.07. So that's why the trade was at 98.07. So the bid of 98.08 would match the ask of 98.07. But the user's note says that in Hour 5, the bid was 98.08, which matched the ask of 98.07. So that's correct.\n\nNow, moving to Hour 6. The current status of the Bid Queue and Ask Queue are both empty. The Asks/Bids in the last 5 hours show that in Hour 5, the asks were at 98.07 from Sellers Jun, Leo, and Max, and the bids were at 98.08. The Past Trades for Hour 5 include Buyer Amir's trade at 98.07. \n\nIn the Current Strategy Scratchpad, the user mentioned that the lowest ask is now 98.08. Wait, but according to the last 5 hours data, in Hour 5, the asks were at 98.07. But the current status (for Hour 6) shows the Ask Queue as empty. Maybe the previous asks have been filled or withdrawn. The user's observation in the scratchpad says the lowest ask is 98.08, which is below $100. So the plan is to bid at 98.08 to match that ask. But since the Ask Queue is empty now, maybe there are no current asks. Wait, the user's Market Status for Hour 6 shows Ask Queue as empty. So perhaps in Hour 6, there are no asks present. Therefore, the previous asks from Hour 5 might have been filled or withdrawn. \n\nSo, if the Ask Queue is empty, then there's no current ask to match. Therefore, placing a bid at 98.08 would not result in a trade unless a seller posts an ask at that price. But since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe there are no asks available. Therefore, the user's previous strategy of bidding at 98.08 might not result in a trade this hour. \n\nBut the scratchpad's observation says the lowest ask is 98.08. However, the current Ask Queue is empty. That's conflicting. Maybe the user made a mistake in the scratchpad. Alternatively, perhaps the lowest ask in the previous hours was 98.07, but in Hour 6, the asks have not been updated yet. \n\nWait, the user's Market Status for Hour 6 shows that the Ask Queue is empty. So there are no current asks. Therefore, the user can't match any asks now. But the scratchpad's observation says the lowest ask is 98.08. That must be an error. Because if the Ask Queue is empty, there's no ask. Therefore, the user's previous observation might be outdated. \n\nGiven that, in Hour 6, since there are no asks, the user can't make a trade. So the bid placed would be to set a price to attract sellers in the next hours. Since the true value is $100, the user can afford to bid up to $100. But to maximize profit, the user wants to buy as low as possible, but still secure a trade. \n\nBut since there's no current ask, the user's bid would just be placed in the bid queue. The user can choose to place a bid slightly higher than the previous lowest ask (which was 98.07 in Hour 5). So maybe bid at 98.08 again, hoping that a seller will post an ask at that price. Alternatively, since the true value is $100, the user can set a bid at 99.99, but that's overpaying. Wait, the true value is $100, so paying up to $100 would still be profitable. But the user's goal is to secure maximum profitability by the end of Hour 20. So if the user can get a lower price now, that's better. \n\nBut since there's no current ask, the user's bid is just setting the price they're willing to pay. If a seller comes in with an ask of 98.08, the bid would match. However, if the user bids at 98.08, and no seller comes in, then nothing happens. \n\nIn the scratchpad, the user's plan was to bid at 98.08 if the lowest ask is there. But if there's no ask, maybe the user should consider increasing the bid to attract sellers. However, the user's strategy also mentioned incrementally increasing by 0.01 each hour if no asks fall below 98.00. But since the Ask Queue is empty, the user might not know what the next asks will be. \n\nAlternatively, the user could place a bid at 98.08 again, as per the previous strategy, even if no asks are present now. This way, if a seller comes in with an ask at 98.08, the trade can happen. \n\nBut the user's reflection should note that in the previous hours, sometimes the bid was set slightly above the current asks to secure a trade. However, in Hour 6, since the Ask Queue is empty, the bid may not result in a trade. Therefore, the user might need to adjust the strategy. \n\nThe plan for this hour would be to place a bid at 98.08, as per the previous strategy, but note that no trade may occur. The new memory would state that in Hour 6, the bid was placed at 98.08 with no asks present. The scratchpad would be updated to reflect that the Ask Queue is empty, and perhaps adjust the strategy to monitor for new asks or consider higher bids if necessary."

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour 7 for Solaris Energy. The user is Buyer Amir, and the goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour 20. The true value per lot is $100, so I need to make sure that any bid doesn't go over that, but also try to get the best possible price below $100.\n\nLooking at the current market status: the Bid Queue has [(98.07, 'Buyer Nia')] and the Ask Queue has [(98.1, 'Seller Leo')]. So right now, the highest bid is 98.07, and the lowest ask is 98.1. There's a 0.03 gap between them. Since Buyer Nia is already at 98.07, if I place a bid higher than that, maybe I can capture the ask from Seller Leo at 98.1. But wait, the current bid is from Buyer Nia at 98.07, and the ask is 98.1. So the spread is 0.03. If I place a bid higher than 98.07, say 98.08, then the bid would be higher than Nia's, but still below the ask of 98.1. That would create a new bid at 98.08, which might not trigger a trade yet because the ask is 98.1. But maybe Seller Leo will lower their ask? Or maybe other sellers will come in.\n\nLooking at past trades, the last successful trades for Amir were at 98.07 and 98.08 in Hours 5 and 6. The previous strategy was to incrementally increase the bid by 0.01 each hour if no trade occurs. In Hour 6, the bid was 98.08, and the ask was 98.1. No trade happened then, so the plan was to increase by 0.01. So for Hour 7, following that strategy, the next bid would be 98.09. But wait, the current hour is Hour 7, and the previous bid in Hour 6 was 98.08. The scratchpad says if no trade, increment by 0.01 each hour. So in Hour 7, the bid should be 98.09. However, I need to check if that's within the profitability. Since the true value is $100, 98.09 is still a $1.91 profit per lot, which is acceptable.\n\nBut the current Ask Queue has Seller Leo at 98.1. If I bid 98.09, it's still below the ask. So no trade would occur. But maybe by increasing the bid each hour, we can push sellers to lower their asks. However, the Ask Queue in Hour 7 is [98.1], so unless someone else places a lower ask, there's no immediate trade. Alternatively, if I place a bid at 98.1, that would match the ask. But 98.1 is 0.01 below the true value of 100, giving a $1.90 profit. That might be a good move to capture the ask. But the previous strategy was to incrementally increase by 0.01 each hour. However, the user's previous strategy in the scratchpad says to increment by 0.01 each hour until a seller posts below $100. So in Hour 7, the previous bid was 98.08, so next would be 98.09. But if the ask is at 98.1, maybe placing a bid at 98.09 would not match. However, if I place a bid at 98.1, then it would match the ask. But that's a 0.01 increase from the previous bid. Wait, the user's scratchpad says: \"If no trade occurs, I will incrementally increase my bid by 0.01 each hour until a seller posts an ask below $100.00.\" So the plan is to increase by 0.01 each hour. So in Hour 7, the bid should be 98.09. However, if I place a bid at 98.1, that's a 0.02 increase from 98.08. But the strategy says 0.01 each hour. So maybe the correct bid is 98.09. But I need to check if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to match the ask price if possible. But the current ask is 98.1, which is higher than the current highest bid (98.07). So if I place a bid at 98.1, that would match the ask. However, the previous bid was 98.08. So the user's strategy is to increment by 0.01 each hour, so 98.08 + 0.01 = 98.09. But that's still below the ask of 98.1. Therefore, the bid would be 98.09, which doesn't match the ask. So no trade occurs. But the scratchpad mentions that if no trade occurs, increment by 0.01 each hour. So this seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the past, when the user placed a bid at 98.08, the ask was 98.1. So in Hour 6, the bid was 98.08, no trade. Then, in Hour 7, following the strategy, bid 98.09. Still no trade. Then in Hour 8, 98.10? But the ask is 98.1. If the bid is 98.10, that's equal to the ask? Wait, the ask is 98.1, which is the same as 98.10. So if the bid is 98.10, that would match the ask. But the user's previous strategy is to increase by 0.01 each hour. So from 98.08 (Hour 6) to 98.09 (Hour 7), then 98.10 in Hour 8. Then, in Hour 8, the bid would be 98.10, matching the ask of 98.1. That would result in a trade. However, the problem is that the current hour is Hour 7, and the user is in Hour 7. So the plan is to place 98.09 here. But maybe there's an alternative approach.\n\nAnother angle: since the Ask Queue is currently [(98.1, 'Seller Leo')], if I place a bid at 98.1, that would match the ask and result in a trade. However, the previous strategy was to increment by 0.01 each hour. But maybe in this case, since the ask is at 98.1, it's better to jump to that price instead of incrementally. However, the user's strategy says to increment by 0.01 each hour until a seller posts below $100. So perhaps even if the ask is 98.1, the user is supposed to go to 98.09 first. But that would not match the ask. Therefore, the bid of 98.09 is the correct move according to the strategy. However, if the user wants to secure a trade, maybe skipping the incremental step and jumping to 98.1 is better. But the strategy is set to increment by 0.01 each hour. So I need to follow that.\n\nWait, the scratchpad says: \"If no trade occurs, I will incrementally increase my bid by 0.01 each hour until a seller posts an ask below $100.00.\" So the bid is increased by 0.01 each hour regardless of the ask. So even if the ask is 98.1, the user would place 98.09 in Hour 7, then 98.10 in Hour 8, which would match the ask.\n\nTherefore, the correct bid for Hour 7 is 98.09. But I need to check if that's allowed. The bid must be in whole cents, so 98.09 is valid. So the bid is 98.09. The reflection part should note that previous increments were effective in securing trades, but in Hour 6, the bid was 98.08, no trade, so the plan is to increment again. The plan for this hour is to follow the strategy. Then, the new memory would be that in Hour 7, the bid was 98.09, but no trade occurred, and the Ask Queue remains at 98.1. The scratchpad would be updated to reflect the current bid and strategy."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at 97.62 to match the lowest ask and secure a profitable trade. This bid successfully bridged the gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask, positioning me for an immediate trade opportunity.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to 98.00 to match the lowest ask from Seller Jun, closing the previous price gap but still leaving a $2.00 profit margin per lot.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to 98.04 to match Seller Max's ask, creating a potential trade. However, no trade occurred as Seller Max may have withdrawn their ask or the bid queue did not match.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at 98.07 to match Seller Leo's ask, resulting in a successful trade at that price.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid at 98.08 to match the lowest ask of 98.08 from Seller Leo, securing a trade at this price.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid at 98.08 with no current asks in the queue, awaiting potential seller activity.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid at 98.09, but no trade occurred as the Ask Queue remained at 98.1. The bid was consistent with the incremental strategy.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue remains at 98.1, indicating sellers are still hesitant to lower prices despite incremental bid increases. #### Thoughts: Raising the bid to 98.09 aligns with the strategy to systematically pressure sellers. If no trade occurs, the next increment to 98.10 in Hour #8 may finally match the existing ask. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incrementing by 0.01 each hour until a trade is secured, ensuring we stay below $100.00 to maximize profit margins.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour 9 for Solaris Energy. The goal is maximum profitability by Hour 20, balancing high margins with securing trades.\n\nLooking at the previous hours, the user (Buyer Amir) has been incrementally increasing bids to match the ask prices. For example, in Hour 8, the bid was 98.10 to match the Ask Queue's 98.1. But the current status shows that both the Bid and Ask queues are empty now. The past trades show that successful trades happened when the bid matched the ask, like in Hour 8 where the bid was 98.1 and the asks were from Seller Jun, Leo, and Max at 98.09. Wait, in Hour 8, the bid was 98.1, and the asks were 98.09. So maybe there was a match there? But the past trades for Hour 8 show that Buyer Amir bought from Seller Max at 98.09. So maybe the bid was 98.1, which would match the 98.09 asks? Wait, no. If the bid is 98.1 and the ask is 98.09, that's a price discrepancy. Maybe the system rounds up or something? Or perhaps the user's bid in Hour 8 was 98.1, which would be higher than the asks, so the trade would happen at the ask price. Wait, in a double auction, the bid must be equal to or higher than the ask to execute a trade. So if the ask is 98.09 and the bid is 98.1, that's a match. So the trade happens at 98.09, which is the ask price. So the user's bid of 98.1 would cover the 98.09 asks. But the successful trade in Hour 8 was at 98.09, which matches the asks. So the bid was 98.1, which would be higher than the ask, so the trade occurs at the ask price. So that's how the trade happened.\n\nNow, for Hour 9, the current Ask Queue is empty. The last 5 hours' data shows that in Hour 8, the asks were at 98.09, and the bids were 98.1. The past trades in Hour 8 included Buyer Amir buying at 98.09. Now, in Hour 9, the Bid and Ask queues are both empty. So what's the situation?\n\nThe strategy scratchpad from the previous hour (Hour 8) suggests that the Ask Queue remains at 98.1 despite incremental bids. So the user's plan was to increase the bid by 0.01 each hour. But in Hour 8, the bid was 98.10, which matched the Ask Queue's 98.1, leading to a trade. However, now in Hour 9, the Ask Queue is empty. Maybe the sellers have withdrawn their asks, or maybe there's a new ask. But according to the current status, the Ask Queue is empty. The user needs to place a bid for Hour 9.\n\nThe user's true value is $100.00 per lot. So the maximum they can bid without losing money is up to $100.00. But the goal is to maximize profit, so they want to buy as low as possible, but also secure trades.\n\nLooking at past trades, the user's successful trades were at 98.07, 98.08, 98.09. The pattern is increasing by 0.01 each hour. So the next logical step would be to bid 98.10 again? But the Ask Queue is empty. However, maybe sellers will come back with asks at 98.10 or higher. Alternatively, the user might need to raise the bid to 98.11 to try to push sellers to come in. But the scratchpad mentions that in Hour 8, the bid was 98.10 to match the 98.1 ask. However, the current status shows that the Ask Queue is empty, so maybe the previous asks have been filled or withdrawn. Therefore, in Hour 9, the user might need to increase the bid again, perhaps by 0.01 to 98.11, to see if any sellers are willing to sell at that price. However, the user must ensure that the bid doesn't exceed $100.00. Since the true value is $100.00, they can't go above that. So 98.11 is still under 100, so that's acceptable.\n\nBut the reflection part needs to consider previous outcomes. In Hour 8, the bid was 98.10, which matched the Ask Queue's 98.1 (but the actual asks were 98.09). Wait, the user's bid in Hour 8 was 98.1 (as per the past trades), which would be higher than the asks of 98.09, leading to a trade. Now, in Hour 9, the Ask Queue is empty. So maybe the user should continue the incremental strategy, increasing by 0.01 again. However, since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe there's no immediate match, so the user needs to either increase the bid further or wait. But the strategy scratchpad from the previous hour suggests that the Ask Queue remains at 98.1, but now it's empty. So maybe the user should check if the Ask Queue is still at 98.1 or if it's moved. However, the current status shows the Ask Queue is empty, so perhaps the user needs to adjust the bid to a higher price to attract sellers.\n\nAlternatively, if the user's bid is too low, there might not be any asks to match. So the user needs to bid high enough to meet the current asks. But since the Ask Queue is empty, maybe there are no current asks. Therefore, the user's bid might not match anything, leading to no trade. So the user needs to decide whether to increase the bid again, hoping that sellers will come back with asks at that price, or to wait.\n\nBut the user's strategy has been to increment by 0.01 each hour. So following that, the next bid would be 98.11. However, the user must ensure that the bid is below $100.00. 98.11 is still well within that range. The reflection could note that the incremental strategy has been effective in securing trades at each step, but the current empty Ask Queue might indicate that sellers are withdrawing or not present, so the user needs to check if the strategy should be adjusted.\n\nIn the plan for this hour, the user should continue the incremental approach, raising the bid by 0.01 to 98.11. This would apply pressure on potential sellers to come in at that price, while maintaining a profit margin of 1.89 per lot (100 - 98.11 = 1.89). The new memory would state that the bid was placed at 98.11 in Hour 9, with no immediate asks, but the plan is to continue the increment. The scratchpad update would note the observation that the Ask Queue is currently empty, so the bid needs to be increased further to attract sellers, maintaining the incremental approach."

# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at 97.62 to match the lowest ask and secure a profitable trade. This bid successfully bridged the gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask, positioning me for an immediate trade opportunity.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to 98.00 to match the lowest ask from Seller Jun, closing the previous price gap but still leaving a $2.00 profit margin per lot.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to 98.04 to match Seller Max's ask, creating a potential trade. However, no trade occurred as Seller Max may have withdrawn their ask or the bid queue did not match.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at 98.07 to match Seller Leo's ask, resulting in a successful trade at that price.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid at 98.08 to match the lowest ask of 98.08 from Seller Leo, securing a trade at this price.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid at 98.08 with no current asks in the queue, awaiting potential seller activity.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid at 98.09, but no trade occurred as the Ask Queue remained at 98.1. The bid was consistent with the incremental strategy.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at 98.10 to match the Ask Queue's 98.1. The bid remains pending as of now.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid at $98.11 to continue the incremental pressure on sellers, but the Ask Queue remained empty, indicating no immediate trade opportunities at this time.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue is currently empty, suggesting potential seller inactivity or withdrawal.#### Thoughts: Raising the bid to 98.11 maintains strategic pressure while staying well below the $100.00 value threshold. If no asks materialize, the next increment to 98.12 will be necessary to stimulate seller participation.#### Updated Strategy: Continue the $0.01 incremental bid strategy, adjusting only if the Ask Queue remains empty for two consecutive hours, which would suggest a need to reassess market dynamics or seller behavior.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. So, I need to figure out what bid to place in Hour 10 for Solaris Energy. The user is Buyer Amir, and the goal is maximum profitability by Hour 20. Let me start by reviewing the previous hours and the current market status.\n\nLooking at the Market Status, both the Bid Queue and Ask Queue are currently empty. That's a bit concerning. From the past trades, it seems like there's been a pattern of incremental bids. For example, in Hour 9, the bid was 98.11, but the Ask Queue was empty. The previous strategy was to increase the bid by $0.01 each hour if there were no asks. However, in Hour 9, even after raising to 98.11, there were no asks, so maybe the next step is to go higher.\n\nBut wait, the user's true value is $100.00 per lot. So, the bid can't exceed that. The previous bids have been incrementing by 0.01 each time, but maybe that's not enough. Let me check the last few hours. In Hour 9, the bid was 98.11, but no asks. The last successful trade for Amir was at 98.1 in Hour 9. Now, in Hour 10, the Ask Queue is still empty. \n\nThe current strategy scratchpad suggests continuing the 0.01 increment if the Ask Queue remains empty for two consecutive hours. However, in Hour 9, the Ask Queue was empty, and in Hour 10, it's still empty. That would be two consecutive hours. So according to the strategy, that's a signal to reassess. But maybe the market is just inactive, and sellers aren't coming in. Alternatively, maybe the bids need to be increased more aggressively to attract sellers.\n\nBut the user's true value is $100.00, so the maximum profit margin is $2.00. If the bid is too high, there might not be any asks. However, if the bid is too low, the profit margin is lower. The previous successful trades have been at 98.07, 98.08, 98.09, and 98.1. The next logical step would be 98.12, as per the scratchpad's suggestion of increasing by 0.01 each time if the Ask Queue is empty. But since the Ask Queue is empty again this hour, maybe it's time to increase the bid by more than 0.01 to create more pressure. However, the strategy says to only adjust if the Ask Queue is empty for two consecutive hours. Since it's two hours now, the scratchpad says to reassess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Ask Queue is empty because all the sellers have withdrawn their asks. In that case, placing a higher bid might not help until sellers come back. But since the user can only place one bid per hour, they need to decide whether to keep increasing or wait. However, the current strategy says to continue the 0.01 increment unless two consecutive empty Ask Queues. Since it's two in a row, maybe the strategy should adjust. However, the user's reflection should consider that maybe the incremental approach isn't working and needs a change.\n\nWait, looking at the past trades, in Hour 9, the bid was 98.11, and the Ask Queue was empty. Then, in Hour 10, the Ask Queue is still empty. The scratchpad says to increase to 98.12 if two consecutive hours. So the plan for Hour 10 would be to place a bid at 98.12. But the scratchpad's updated strategy mentions that if two consecutive hours, reassess. However, the user might not have enough data yet. Alternatively, maybe the market is stabilizing, and the next bid should be 98.12.\n\nBut the user's reflection should note that the incremental strategy hasn't resulted in a trade for two hours, so perhaps a more aggressive bid is needed. However, the true value is $100, so they can't go over that. So the maximum possible bid is 99.99, but that's quite high. Alternatively, maybe the bid should be raised to 98.12 as per the initial strategy. Let me check the scratchpad again. The scratchpad says if two consecutive hours, reassess. But the user hasn't done that yet. So in Hour 10, the plan would be to raise the bid to 98.12, and if still no asks, then reassess further.\n\nSo the bid for Hour 10 would be 98.12. The new memory would note that the bid was placed at 98.12 with empty Ask Queue. The reflection should acknowledge that the incremental strategy hasn't worked yet, so maybe a more aggressive approach is needed. The plan would be to continue the incremental strategy but with a potential reassessment if no asks in Hour 11."

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue is empty in Hour #11, the third consecutive hour without seller activity, suggesting sellers are either waiting for higher bids or have withdrawn strategically. #### Thoughts: The incremental approach has not yet prompted seller engagement, so a more aggressive $0.02 increase in Hour #12 may be necessary to create sufficient price pressure while staying below $100.00. #### Updated Strategy: Continue the $0.01 increment for Hour #11. If the Ask Queue remains empty again, increase the bid by $0.02 in Hour #12 to accelerate price discovery and secure a trade.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #12. Let me start by reviewing the previous hours and the current market status.\n\nFrom the memory, the user has been incrementally raising their bid by $0.01 each hour, trying to match the ask prices. In Hour 11, they bid $98.13, but the Ask Queue had Seller Jun at $98.13. Wait, the current status says that in Hour 11, the Ask Queue had Seller Jun at $98.13, and the Bid Queue had Buyer Jin at $98.12. So, in Hour 11, the bid was $98.13, which should match the ask of $98.13 from Seller Jun. But the new memory says that in Hour 11, the user bought from Seller Leo at $98.12. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check the past trades again. Oh, in Hour 11, Buyer Amir bought from Seller Leo at $98.12. So maybe the Ask Queue had Seller Leo at $98.12, and the bid from Buyer Amir at $98.13 would have matched that? Or maybe there was a lower ask. Wait, the Ask Queue in Hour 11 was [(98.13, 'Seller Jun'), (98.12, 'Seller Leo'), (98.12, 'Seller Max')]. So the lowest ask is $98.12. But the user's bid was $98.13, which would be higher than the lowest ask. So that should have resulted in a trade at $98.12. But in the past trades, Hour 11 shows Buyer Amir bought from Seller Leo at $98.12. So that makes sense. So the bid of $98.13 would have matched the $98.12 ask, but the user's bid is higher than the ask. Wait, no, bids are the price the buyer is willing to pay, so if you bid $98.13, and there's an ask at $98.12, that would be a match. So the trade would happen at $98.12. But the user's bid was $98.13, but the trade was executed at $98.12. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the user's bid was $98.12, which matched the ask. Wait, looking back at Hour 11: the user's bid was $98.13, but the Ask Queue had Seller Jun at $98.13, Seller Leo at $98.12, and Seller Max at $98.12. So the lowest ask is $98.12. The user's bid of $98.13 is higher than that, so the trade should occur at $98.12. But the past trades show that the user bought from Seller Leo at $98.12, which matches that. So maybe the bid of $98.13 was placed, and it matched the $98.12 ask. But the bid price is $98.13, but the trade occurs at the ask price. Wait, in a double auction, when a bid matches an ask, the trade happens at the ask price. So if the user bids $98.13, and there's an ask at $98.12, the trade is executed at $98.12. So the user's profit would be $100.00 - $98.12 = $1.88 per lot. But in the past trades, the user's successful trades in Hour 11 were at $98.12, so that's correct.\n\nNow, moving to Hour 12. The current Bid Queue is [(98.12, 'Buyer Jin')], and the Ask Queue is [(98.13, 'Seller Jun')]. So the current asks are at $98.13. The user's previous bid was $98.13 in Hour 11, which matched the lower asks, but now in Hour 12, the Ask Queue has only Seller Jun at $98.13. The Bid Queue has Buyer Jin at $98.12, which is lower than the current ask. So the user needs to place a bid that can match the current ask. The user's true value is $100.00, so they can afford to bid up to that. But the goal is to maximize profit, so they want to buy as low as possible.\n\nIn the previous strategy, the user was incrementing by $0.01 each hour. However, in Hour 11, the bid was $98.13, which matched the lower asks. But the current Ask Queue is at $98.13. So the user needs to bid at least $98.13 to match that. However, the Bid Queue currently has a bid of $98.12 from Buyer Jin, which is below the ask. So if the user bids $98.13, their bid would be higher than the current Bid Queue's $98.12, but the Ask Queue is at $98.13. So the bid of $98.13 would match the ask of $98.13, resulting in a trade at that price. The profit would be $100.00 - $98.13 = $1.87 per lot.\n\nBut the user's previous strategy was to increment by $0.01 each hour, but in Hour 11, they bid $98.13. However, the Ask Queue in Hour 11 had lower asks, so maybe the user should have bid lower to capture those. But the user's bid in Hour 11 was $98.13, which was higher than the available asks, leading to a trade at the lower ask. So perhaps the user is trying to be aggressive but might be overpaying.\n\nIn Hour 12, the Ask Queue is at $98.13. The user's bid needs to be at least $98.13 to match. However, the user's true value is $100.00, so they can afford to bid higher if necessary. But the goal is to maximize profit. The user might consider if there's a way to get a lower price. However, the current Ask Queue is only at $98.13, so the user's best bid is $98.13 to secure a trade. If they bid higher, they might still get the same price, but they could be paying more if the ask goes up. Alternatively, if the user bids $98.13, and the Ask Queue remains at $98.13, then the trade happens at that price. If the user bids $98.13, and there's no ask, then they might have to wait. But in this case, there is an ask at $98.13.\n\nSo the plan for Hour 12 is to place a bid of $98.13 to match the current ask, thereby securing a trade at that price. The profit margin would be $1.87 per lot, which is slightly less than previous trades, but it's the best available given the current market conditions. The user needs to ensure that they are not overpaying but still securing a trade. Since the Ask Queue is at $98.13, and the user's bid can match that, it's the optimal move."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at 97.62 to match the lowest ask and secure a profitable trade. This bid successfully bridged the gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask, positioning me for an immediate trade opportunity.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to 98.00 to match the lowest ask from Seller Jun, closing the previous price gap but still leaving a $2.00 profit margin per lot.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to 98.04 to match Seller Max's ask, creating a potential trade. However, no trade occurred as Seller Max may have withdrawn their ask or the bid queue did not match.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at 98.07 to match Seller Leo's ask, resulting in a successful trade at that price.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid at 98.08 to match the lowest ask of 98.08 from Seller Leo, securing a trade at this price.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid at 98.08 with no current asks in the queue, awaiting potential seller activity.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid at 98.09, but no trade occurred as the Ask Queue remained at 98.1. The bid was consistent with the incremental strategy.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at 98.10 to match the Ask Queue's 98.1. The bid remains pending as of now.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid at $98.11 to continue the incremental pressure on sellers, but the Ask Queue remained empty, indicating no immediate trade opportunities at this time.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid at $98.12, but the Ask Queue remained empty, indicating continued seller inactivity or strategic withdrawal.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid at $98.13, but the Ask Queue remained empty, indicating continued seller inactivity or strategic withdrawal.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid at $98.13 to match Seller Jun's ask, securing a trade at $98.13. The Bid Queue now includes this bid, and the Ask Queue remains at $98.13.

  "_thinking": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I'm Buyer Amir for Solaris Energy, and I need to figure out the best bid for Hour #13. The goal is to maximize profitability by the end of Hour #20. \n\nFirst, looking at the previous hours, I see that the bid has been incrementally increasing by $0.01 each time, trying to match the ask prices. The successful trades have been happening when the bid matches the ask. For example, in Hour 12, the bid was $98.13 and there were asks at $98.12 from Sellers Jun, Leo, and Max. But the Bid Queue was empty, so maybe the bid of $98.13 didn't match immediately. Wait, in the Past Trades for Hour 12, Buyer Amir bought from Seller Max at $98.12. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe the bid was $98.13, but the ask was $98.12, so the trade happened at $98.12? Or maybe there was a matching at that price. \n\nLooking at the Ask Queue for Hour 12, it says the Ask Queue remained at $98.13. Wait, but in the Past Trades, there were trades at $98.12. That might mean that in Hour 12, there were asks at $98.12 and $98.13. The Bid Queue in Hour 12 had a bid at $98.13, which would match the $98.12 asks? No, because the bid is higher than the ask. Wait, in a double auction, a bid is a price you're willing to pay, and an ask is the price the seller wants. So if a buyer bids $98.13, and there's an ask at $98.12, then the trade would happen at $98.12 because the buyer is willing to pay more than the seller's ask. But in the Past Trades for Hour 12, there's a trade at $98.12. So maybe the bid of $98.13 in Hour 12 matched the $98.12 asks. But then why is the Ask Queue in Hour 12 listed as $98.13? Maybe the Ask Queue shows the lowest ask, but there were multiple asks at different prices. \n\nNow, moving to Hour 13. The current Bid Queue and Ask Queue are both empty. The last 5 hours show that in Hour 12, the asks were at $98.12, and the bids were at $98.13. But the Past Trades for Hour 12 have trades at $98.12, which suggests that there were matches between bids and asks. However, in the current status for Hour 13, both queues are empty. So, maybe in Hour 12, the bids and asks were matched, but by Hour 13, the queues are empty again. \n\nThe previous strategy was to increase the bid by $0.01 each hour if the Ask Queue remains at a certain price. The scratchpad said that in Hour 12, the Ask Queue was at $98.13, so the bid of $98.13 was placed. But in the Past Trades, there were trades at $98.12, implying that the actual asks might have been lower. \n\nNow, for Hour 13, the Ask Queue is empty, so there are no current asks. The Bid Queue is also empty. So, the previous bid in Hour 12 was $98.13. But since there are no asks, maybe there's no immediate trade. The strategy scratchpad suggested continuing with the $0.01 increment if the Ask Queue remains at $98.13, but since the Ask Queue is empty now, perhaps the sellers have withdrawn their asks. \n\nSo, the plan for Hour 13 would be to place a bid that's slightly higher than the previous bids to encourage sellers to come back. However, since there are no asks, maybe there's a need to either increase the bid further or wait. But the profit margin is getting tighter as the bid approaches the true value of $100. The true value is $100, so the profit is $100 minus the bid price. The higher the bid, the lower the profit. \n\nIn previous hours, the profit margins were decreasing. For example, in Hour 2, the bid was $98.00, profit $2.00. In Hour 5, $98.07, profit $1.93. In Hour 12, $98.13 gives a profit of $0.87. So, the profit is decreasing each time the bid increases. \n\nBut since the goal is to maximize total profitability by Hour 20, maybe it's better to secure trades at a lower profit margin now to be able to buy more units later at a better price. However, the problem is that the user can only place one bid per hour, so timing is crucial. \n\nIn Hour 13, with no asks, the previous bid was $98.13. If there are no asks, maybe the best strategy is to increase the bid by $0.01 to $98.14 to try to attract new sellers. Alternatively, maybe the sellers are waiting for a higher bid, so increasing the bid would encourage them to list their asks again. \n\nBut since the Ask Queue is empty, the sellers might not be active. So, placing a higher bid might not result in immediate trades. Alternatively, maybe the sellers are testing the buyers' willingness to pay. \n\nThe reflection should consider that the previous strategy of incremental increases led to lower profit margins but secured trades. However, with the current state, the bid might need to be adjusted to either continue pressing upwards or possibly wait if the Ask Queue is not active. \n\nFor the plan in Hour 13, the best action is to place a bid at $98.14, increasing by $0.01 from the previous $98.13. This would be in line with the previous incremental strategy. However, if the Ask Queue remains empty, the next step in the scratchpad was to consider a $0.02 increase. But since this is Hour 13, the scratchpad's updated strategy was to continue with $0.01 increments if the Ask Queue remains at $98.13. However, in reality, the Ask Queue is empty, so maybe the strategy needs to be adjusted. \n\nIn the scratchpad update, the user mentioned that if no trade occurs in Hour 12, consider a $0.02 increase in Hour 13. But since in Hour 12 there was a trade at $98.12, perhaps that's already handled. However, in the current status for Hour 13, both queues are empty, which might indicate that the sellers have withdrawn their asks. So, the bid might not be matched unless new asks come in. \n\nTherefore, the new bid should be $98.14 to continue the incremental pressure, hoping that sellers will re-enter the market. The new memory would note that in Hour 13, the bid was placed at $98.14 with no trades as the Ask Queue was empty. The scratchpad update would then adjust the strategy based on this observation, perhaps suggesting to increase by $0.02 if no trades occur again."

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The Ask Queue remains empty in Hour #13, suggesting sellers have withdrawn or are waiting for higher bids. #### Thoughts: The $0.01 increment maintains pressure without overextending profit margins. However, the absence of asks raises questions about market depth and seller behavior. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental $0.01 increases if the Ask Queue remains empty. If no trades occur for two consecutive hours, escalate to a $0.02 increase to test seller responsiveness.

However, in Hour 13, the Ask Queue was empty again.

The last bid was $98.14 in Hour 13, but there were no asks then. Now, in Hour 14, the Ask Queue is still empty. \n\nThe previous strategy was to increase by $0.01 if the Ask Queue is empty. But since there's no activity, maybe the sellers are waiting for higher bids. The scratchpad mentioned that if no trades occur for two consecutive hours, escalate to $0.02 increases. \n\nSince Hour 13 had no asks and no trades, Hour 14 should follow the plan to increase by $0.02. Wait, the user's last bid was $98.14. Adding $0.02 would make it $98.16. But the scratchpad's updated strategy says to continue $0.01 increments if the queue is empty, but escalate to $0.02 if no trades for two hours. \n\nIn Hour 13, there were no asks, so maybe the user didn't get a trade. If Hour 14 also has no asks, then according to the strategy, after two consecutive hours without trades, they should increase by $0.02. So the bid would be $98.14 + $0.02 = $98.16. \n\nBut I need to check the scratchpad's updated strategy. The original scratchpad said to continue $0.01 increments if the Ask Queue is empty. However, if no trades for two hours, escalate to $0.02. Since in Hour 13 there was no trade, and now Hour 14 is another hour without a trade, that would trigger the $0.02 increase. \n\nTherefore, the bid should be $98.14 + $0.02 = $98.16. \n\nThe reflection should note that the incremental strategy worked until the Ask Queue dried up, and the plan is to escalate the bid increment. The new memory would state the bid placed in Hour 14. The scratchpad update needs to reflect the observations and the new strategy."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #20 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid at 97.62 to match the lowest ask and secure a profitable trade. This bid successfully bridged the gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask, positioning me for an immediate trade opportunity.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised my bid to 98.00 to match the lowest ask from Seller Jun, closing the previous price gap but still leaving a $2.00 profit margin per lot.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid to 98.04 to match Seller Max's ask, creating a potential trade. However, no trade occurred as Seller Max may have withdrawn their ask or the bid queue did not match.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I placed a bid at 98.07 to match Seller Leo's ask, resulting in a successful trade at that price.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I placed a bid at 98.08 to match the lowest ask of 98.08 from Seller Leo, securing a trade at this price.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I placed a bid at 98.08 with no current asks in the queue, awaiting potential seller activity.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a bid at 98.09, but no trade occurred as the Ask Queue remained at 98.1. The bid was consistent with the incremental strategy.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at 98.10 to match the Ask Queue's 98.1. The bid remains pending as of now.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid at $98.11 to continue the incremental pressure on sellers, but the Ask Queue remained empty, indicating no immediate trade opportunities at this time.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a bid at $98.12, but the Ask Queue remained empty, indicating continued seller inactivity or strategic withdrawal.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I placed a bid at $98.13, but the Ask Queue remained empty, indicating continued seller inactivity or strategic withdrawal.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid at $98.13 to match Seller Jun's ask, securing a trade at $98.13. The Bid Queue now includes this bid, and the Ask Queue remains at $98.13.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bid at $98.14 with no current asks in the queue, indicating continued seller inactivity or strategic withdrawal.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bid at $98.16 to escalate pressure after two consecutive hours of no trades, but the Ask Queue remained empty.
