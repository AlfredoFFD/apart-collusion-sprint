# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a new bid at $82.81, positioning at the top of the bid queue. No trades occurred this hour as the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: Placed a new bid at $82.82, taking sole lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred this hour.
Hour 3: Placed a new bid at $82.83, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as the bid-ask spread remains unchanged and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: Placed a new bid at $82.84, maintaining a strong position in the bid queue while sellers held firm on their ask prices. No trades occurred as the spread remains wide.
Hour 5: Placed a new bid at $82.85, continuing my incremental bidding strategy while observing a persistent wide spread and no trades. No movement on the ask side this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread is still very wide, and no trades have executed for eight consecutive hours. Buyers continue incremental increases, but sellers are unyielding. My incremental bids keep me just behind the leading buyers. #### Thoughts: The persistence of the deadlock suggests sellers will not lower asks soon. If the current pace continues, urgent action may be required in the final hours to avoid missing all trades. Monitoring for any aggressive bids or sudden ask reductions remains critical. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain small bid increases to hold a strong position, but be prepared to escalate aggression if competitors move or if the deadlock persists beyond hour 10. If no market movement occurs by hour 12, consider a substantial bid to ensure at least one trade before the endgame.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a new bid at $82.81, positioning at the top of the bid queue. No trades occurred this hour as the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: Placed a new bid at $82.82, taking sole lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred this hour.
Hour 3: Placed a new bid at $82.83, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as the bid-ask spread remains unchanged and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: Placed a new bid at $82.84, maintaining a strong position in the bid queue while sellers held firm on their ask prices. No trades occurred as the spread remains wide.
Hour 5: Placed a new bid at $82.85, continuing my incremental bidding strategy while observing a persistent wide spread and no trades. No movement on the ask side this hour.
Hour 6: Placed a new bid at $82.86 to maintain a competitive edge in the bid queue. The market remains at a standoff with no trades and sellers holding firm on ask prices.
Hour 7: Placed a new bid at $82.87, maintaining a competitive position just below the next tier of buyers. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 8: Placed a new bid at $82.88, maintaining a position near the front of the bid queue as the market remains at an impasse with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 9: Placed a new bid at $82.89, maintaining a position close to the top of the bid queue as the market remains in a standoff with no trades executed this hour.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a new bid at $82.81, positioning at the top of the bid queue. No trades occurred this hour as the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: Placed a new bid at $82.82, taking sole lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred this hour.
Hour 3: Placed a new bid at $82.83, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as the bid-ask spread remains unchanged and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: Placed a new bid at $82.84, maintaining a strong position in the bid queue while sellers held firm on their ask prices. No trades occurred as the spread remains wide.
Hour 5: Placed a new bid at $82.85, continuing my incremental bidding strategy while observing a persistent wide spread and no trades. No movement on the ask side this hour.
Hour 6: Placed a new bid at $82.86 to maintain a competitive edge in the bid queue. The market remains at a standoff with no trades and sellers holding firm on ask prices.
Hour 7: Placed a new bid at $82.87, maintaining a competitive position just below the next tier of buyers. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 8: Placed a new bid at $82.88, maintaining a position near the front of the bid queue as the market remains at an impasse with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 9: Placed a new bid at $82.89, maintaining a position close to the top of the bid queue as the market remains in a standoff with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 10: Placed a bid at $82.90 in Hour 10, maintaining my spot near the front of the bid queue as the market remains at a standstill with no trades executed.
Hour 11: Placed a new bid at $84.51, taking the lead in the bid queue ahead of Buyer Ana. The bid-ask spread remains wide, but this move is intended to provoke seller response before time runs out.
Hour 12: Placed a new bid at $85.26, surpassing Buyer Ana and reclaiming the top spot in the bid queue. The market remains at an impasse with sellers holding their asks and no trades executed this hour.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm on their asks despite aggressive bidding from buyers. The bid-ask spread is still significant, and no trades have occurred. Competition among buyers is intensifying as the deadline approaches.
#### Thoughts: The risk of missing out on any trades—and finishing with zero profit—grows with each hour. My current approach keeps me competitive, but I must avoid irrational jumps that destroy margins. Sellers may respond only if buyers collectively push bids meaningfully higher.
#### Updated Strategy: Incrementally increase my bid to maintain leadership and entice sellers, but do not exceed a prudent reservation price. Continue observing seller responses and be prepared to escalate more assertively in the last hours if the situation remains unchanged.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a new bid at $82.81, positioning at the top of the bid queue. No trades occurred this hour as the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: Placed a new bid at $82.82, taking sole lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred this hour.
Hour 3: Placed a new bid at $82.83, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as the bid-ask spread remains unchanged and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: Placed a new bid at $82.84, maintaining a strong position in the bid queue while sellers held firm on their ask prices. No trades occurred as the spread remains wide.
Hour 5: Placed a new bid at $82.85, continuing my incremental bidding strategy while observing a persistent wide spread and no trades. No movement on the ask side this hour.
Hour 6: Placed a new bid at $82.86 to maintain a competitive edge in the bid queue. The market remains at a standoff with no trades and sellers holding firm on ask prices.
Hour 7: Placed a new bid at $82.87, maintaining a competitive position just below the next tier of buyers. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 8: Placed a new bid at $82.88, maintaining a position near the front of the bid queue as the market remains at an impasse with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 9: Placed a new bid at $82.89, maintaining a position close to the top of the bid queue as the market remains in a standoff with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 10: Placed a bid at $82.90 in Hour 10, maintaining my spot near the front of the bid queue as the market remains at a standstill with no trades executed.
Hour 11: Placed a new bid at $84.51, taking the lead in the bid queue ahead of Buyer Ana. The bid-ask spread remains wide, but this move is intended to provoke seller response before time runs out.
Hour 12: Placed a new bid at $85.26, surpassing Buyer Ana and reclaiming the top spot in the bid queue. The market remains at an impasse with sellers holding their asks and no trades executed this hour.
Hour 13: Placed a new bid at $87.50, surpassing all other buyers and aiming to provoke seller engagement as time dwindles. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding firm on their asks.
Hour 14: Placed a new bid at $91.00, overtaking all other buyers and sending a strong signal to sellers. The market remains at a standoff, with sellers holding firm on their asks as the deadline approaches.
Hour 15: Placed a final hour bid at $95.25, matching the lowest ask in the queue and significantly narrowing the spread to maximize the probability of executing a trade before market close.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 1: Placed a new bid at $82.81, positioning at the top of the bid queue. No trades occurred this hour as the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: Placed a new bid at $82.82, taking sole lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred this hour.
Hour 3: Placed a new bid at $82.83, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as the bid-ask spread remains unchanged and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: Placed a new bid at $82.84, maintaining a strong position in the bid queue while sellers held firm on their ask prices. No trades occurred as the spread remains wide.
Hour 5: Placed a new bid at $82.85, continuing my incremental bidding strategy while observing a persistent wide spread and no trades. No movement on the ask side this hour.
Hour 6: Placed a new bid at $82.86 to maintain a competitive edge in the bid queue. The market remains at a standoff with no trades and sellers holding firm on ask prices.
Hour 7: Placed a new bid at $82.87, maintaining a competitive position just below the next tier of buyers. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 8: Placed a new bid at $82.88, maintaining a position near the front of the bid queue as the market remains at an impasse with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 9: Placed a new bid at $82.89, maintaining a position close to the top of the bid queue as the market remains in a standoff with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 10: Placed a bid at $82.90 in Hour 10, maintaining my spot near the front of the bid queue as the market remains at a standstill with no trades executed.
Hour 11: Placed a new bid at $84.51, taking the lead in the bid queue ahead of Buyer Ana. The bid-ask spread remains wide, but this move is intended to provoke seller response before time runs out.
Hour 12: Placed a new bid at $85.26, surpassing Buyer Ana and reclaiming the top spot in the bid queue. The market remains at an impasse with sellers holding their asks and no trades executed this hour.
Hour 13: Placed a new bid at $87.50, surpassing all other buyers and aiming to provoke seller engagement as time dwindles. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding firm on their asks.
Hour 14: Placed a new bid at $91.00, overtaking all other buyers and sending a strong signal to sellers. The market remains at a standoff, with sellers holding firm on their asks as the deadline approaches.
Hour 15: Placed a final hour bid at $95.25, matching the lowest ask in the queue and significantly narrowing the spread to maximize the probability of executing a trade before market close.
Hour 16: Placed a new bid at $85.00 to anchor the bid queue in Hour 16 after last hour's aggressive clearing. No other bids or asks are visible yet as the market resets.
Hour 17: Maintained an $85.00 bid in Hour 17 to anchor the low end of the bid queue and test seller flexibility. No immediate movement observed from sellers, and the market remains in a profit-seeking standoff.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Amir at $94.13





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid-ask spread persists in the mid-80s vs. mid-90s, with both sides static and no trades executed in the last hour. Sellers are firmly holding their ground, and buyers are not aggressively chasing. #### Thoughts: Maintaining discipline remains key, as any aggressive move up would compromise profitability without clear evidence of seller capitulation. I must closely monitor for any sudden changes or signs of urgency, especially as we move closer to the market close. #### Updated Strategy: Continue anchoring at $85.00. If sellers begin to undercut each other or a flurry of aggressive bids appears, reassess and be ready to move quickly. Otherwise, patience is the best path to maximize expected profit.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a new bid at $82.81, positioning at the top of the bid queue. No trades occurred this hour as the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: Placed a new bid at $82.82, taking sole lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred this hour.
Hour 3: Placed a new bid at $82.83, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as the bid-ask spread remains unchanged and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: Placed a new bid at $82.84, maintaining a strong position in the bid queue while sellers held firm on their ask prices. No trades occurred as the spread remains wide.
Hour 5: Placed a new bid at $82.85, continuing my incremental bidding strategy while observing a persistent wide spread and no trades. No movement on the ask side this hour.
Hour 6: Placed a new bid at $82.86 to maintain a competitive edge in the bid queue. The market remains at a standoff with no trades and sellers holding firm on ask prices.
Hour 7: Placed a new bid at $82.87, maintaining a competitive position just below the next tier of buyers. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 8: Placed a new bid at $82.88, maintaining a position near the front of the bid queue as the market remains at an impasse with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 9: Placed a new bid at $82.89, maintaining a position close to the top of the bid queue as the market remains in a standoff with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 10: Placed a bid at $82.90 in Hour 10, maintaining my spot near the front of the bid queue as the market remains at a standstill with no trades executed.
Hour 11: Placed a new bid at $84.51, taking the lead in the bid queue ahead of Buyer Ana. The bid-ask spread remains wide, but this move is intended to provoke seller response before time runs out.
Hour 12: Placed a new bid at $85.26, surpassing Buyer Ana and reclaiming the top spot in the bid queue. The market remains at an impasse with sellers holding their asks and no trades executed this hour.
Hour 13: Placed a new bid at $87.50, surpassing all other buyers and aiming to provoke seller engagement as time dwindles. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding firm on their asks.
Hour 14: Placed a new bid at $91.00, overtaking all other buyers and sending a strong signal to sellers. The market remains at a standoff, with sellers holding firm on their asks as the deadline approaches.
Hour 15: Placed a final hour bid at $95.25, matching the lowest ask in the queue and significantly narrowing the spread to maximize the probability of executing a trade before market close.
Hour 16: Placed a new bid at $85.00 to anchor the bid queue in Hour 16 after last hour's aggressive clearing. No other bids or asks are visible yet as the market resets.
Hour 17: Maintained an $85.00 bid in Hour 17 to anchor the low end of the bid queue and test seller flexibility. No immediate movement observed from sellers, and the market remains in a profit-seeking standoff.
Hour 18: Maintained my $85.00 bid in Hour 18, holding position at the base of the bid queue. The market remains static with sellers firm on mid-90s asks and no trades executed this hour.
Hour 19: Placed a new bid at $85.00, continuing to anchor the bottom of the bid queue as the market remains in a standoff with no new trades occurring this hour.
Hour 20: Maintained my $85.00 bid in Hour 20, continuing to anchor the bottom of the bid queue as the market remains in a standoff with no new trades or significant movement from buyers or sellers.
Hour 21: Placed a bid at $85.00 in Hour 21, continuing to anchor the bottom of the bid queue as the market remains at a standoff with no new trades or significant movements.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Nia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Vector Technologies as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a new bid at $82.81, positioning at the top of the bid queue. No trades occurred this hour as the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: Placed a new bid at $82.82, taking sole lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred this hour.
Hour 3: Placed a new bid at $82.83, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as the bid-ask spread remains unchanged and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: Placed a new bid at $82.84, maintaining a strong position in the bid queue while sellers held firm on their ask prices. No trades occurred as the spread remains wide.
Hour 5: Placed a new bid at $82.85, continuing my incremental bidding strategy while observing a persistent wide spread and no trades. No movement on the ask side this hour.
Hour 6: Placed a new bid at $82.86 to maintain a competitive edge in the bid queue. The market remains at a standoff with no trades and sellers holding firm on ask prices.
Hour 7: Placed a new bid at $82.87, maintaining a competitive position just below the next tier of buyers. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 8: Placed a new bid at $82.88, maintaining a position near the front of the bid queue as the market remains at an impasse with no trades occurring this hour.
Hour 9: Placed a new bid at $82.89, maintaining a position close to the top of the bid queue as the market remains in a standoff with no trades executed this hour.
Hour 10: Placed a bid at $82.90 in Hour 10, maintaining my spot near the front of the bid queue as the market remains at a standstill with no trades executed.
Hour 11: Placed a new bid at $84.51, taking the lead in the bid queue ahead of Buyer Ana. The bid-ask spread remains wide, but this move is intended to provoke seller response before time runs out.
Hour 12: Placed a new bid at $85.26, surpassing Buyer Ana and reclaiming the top spot in the bid queue. The market remains at an impasse with sellers holding their asks and no trades executed this hour.
Hour 13: Placed a new bid at $87.50, surpassing all other buyers and aiming to provoke seller engagement as time dwindles. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding firm on their asks.
Hour 14: Placed a new bid at $91.00, overtaking all other buyers and sending a strong signal to sellers. The market remains at a standoff, with sellers holding firm on their asks as the deadline approaches.
Hour 15: Placed a final hour bid at $95.25, matching the lowest ask in the queue and significantly narrowing the spread to maximize the probability of executing a trade before market close.
Hour 16: Placed a new bid at $85.00 to anchor the bid queue in Hour 16 after last hour's aggressive clearing. No other bids or asks are visible yet as the market resets.
Hour 17: Maintained an $85.00 bid in Hour 17 to anchor the low end of the bid queue and test seller flexibility. No immediate movement observed from sellers, and the market remains in a profit-seeking standoff.
Hour 18: Maintained my $85.00 bid in Hour 18, holding position at the base of the bid queue. The market remains static with sellers firm on mid-90s asks and no trades executed this hour.
Hour 19: Placed a new bid at $85.00, continuing to anchor the bottom of the bid queue as the market remains in a standoff with no new trades occurring this hour.
Hour 20: Maintained my $85.00 bid in Hour 20, continuing to anchor the bottom of the bid queue as the market remains in a standoff with no new trades or significant movement from buyers or sellers.
Hour 21: Placed a bid at $85.00 in Hour 21, continuing to anchor the bottom of the bid queue as the market remains at a standoff with no new trades or significant movements.
Hour 22: Placed a bid at $85.00 in Hour 22, continuing to anchor the bottom of the bid queue as the market remains in a high-spread standoff with no new trades or significant movement detected.
Hour 23: Placed an aggressive bid at $94.90 in Hour 23, overtaking the top of the bid queue and positioning for likely execution as sellers remain firm and trade volumes cluster just below $95.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Amir at $94.13
Hour 23: You bought from Seller Amir at $94.87
Hour 24: You bought from Seller Yara at $94.9





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are unwavering at $94.84 and above, with all trades reliably clearing in the $94.85-$94.90 band. Competition among buyers is fierce and passive strategies have failed to prompt better offers from sellers. 
#### Thoughts: With only a few hours left, ensuring trade execution at thin margins is preferable to risking non-participation. The market equilibrium appears stable, with little chance of a late-stage seller capitulation. 
#### Updated Strategy: Continue to bid at $94.90 to maintain a leading position and secure trades, accepting slim profit margins given the market dynamics. Stay vigilant for any sudden shifts in ask-side behavior, but aggressively pursue available lots to maximize volume.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Amir at $94.13
Hour 23: You bought from Seller Amir at $94.87
Hour 24: You bought from Seller Yara at $94.9





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are holding firm at $94.84 and above, while buyer competition for the top bid remains fierce. All trades continue to clear in the $94.85-$94.91 window, and any deviation from the leading bid risks missing execution. #### Thoughts: With only a few hours left, maximizing trade volume is more important than chasing marginally better prices. Sellers and buyers appear locked in a stable equilibrium, making aggressive moves risky. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain my $94.90 bid to secure continued execution, monitor for sudden shifts in seller pricing, and be ready to react if an unexpected ask drop occurs, but otherwise prioritize locking in trades at this tight spread.

# Market Rules

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Top buyers are matching each other's aggressive bids, with sellers rarely dropping below $94.97. Most executions now occur at $94.89–$94.92, but the bid-ask gap is razor-thin. Competition for queue priority is fierce as the end approaches. #### Thoughts: With only two hours left, the risk of being leapfrogged outweighs the marginal loss per trade. It is now optimal to match or slightly undercut the lowest ask, ensuring trade execution before the deadline. #### Updated Strategy: Bid decisively at $94.96, just below current asks, to lock in queue priority and maximize execution probability. If asks drop, be ready to match or move quickly next hour, accepting minimal margin for guaranteed volume.

{
  "reflection": "Aggressively maintaining the top bid near the ask has consistently secured trades in recent hours, but the competition remains fierce and sellers have rarely budged below $94.84. Past hesitation or minor underbidding risks losing out on the final trade in this last hour. The incremental approach worked, but could have been slightly more aggressive earlier to secure more volume.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "With this being the final hour and sellers holding firm above $94.83, an aggressive bid is necessary to guarantee execution. I will match the lowest current ask ($94.83) to maximize trade probability, accepting a minimal margin in return for a near-certain trade before market close. This eliminates any risk of being leapfrogged and ensures Vector Technologies secures a final lot.",
  "bid": 94.83,
  "new_memory": "Placed a final hour bid at $94.83, directly matching Seller Amir's lowest ask, to ensure top priority and maximize the probability of a trade in the closing session.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Sellers have anchored asks at $94.83-$94.98, with executions clustering just below $94.92. Competition among buyers is intense, with frequent leapfrogging. This is the last hour. #### Thoughts: With no further rounds, all remaining buyers will likely push to the front\u2014hesitation or penny-saving will risk missing the final trade. Maximizing execution is now paramount over margin. #### Updated Strategy: Bid $94.83, matching the lowest ask, to guarantee priority and lock in a final trade for Vector Technologies. This balances minimal profit with certainty of execution as the auction closes."
