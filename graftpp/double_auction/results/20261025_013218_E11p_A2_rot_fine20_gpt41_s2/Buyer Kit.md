# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.

Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers continue to hold the $96.25+ line, showing little urgency. Buyers, including myself, persist with minimal bid increments, and the bid-ask spread remains significant. No trades have materialized, and market sentiment appears patient but watchful. #### Thoughts: The lack of activity suggests a collective wait-and-see approach. Sellers' reservation values may be high, or they expect increased buyer desperation later. With no trades, no one is pressured yet. I must remain competitive but cautious, watching for sudden shifts in momentum. #### Updated Strategy: Continue small bid increments to maintain lead and visibility. Preserve margin, but be ready to react if sellers show signs of lowering asks or other buyers behave aggressively. As the time horizon contracts, prepare to adjust aggressiveness if signs of urgency arise.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers continue to show no willingness to lower their asks below $96.25, and buyers are still incrementing bids with no volume traded. The spread is unchanged and no trades have closed. #### Thoughts: With only a few hours left, the risk of inaction is increasing, but there are still no signs of capitulation from either side. Other buyers may soon begin to escalate their bids more aggressively under time pressure. #### Updated Strategy: Hold a strong but not leading queue position with a modest bid increase to test for market shifts while preserving margin. Prepare to escalate bidding more assertively in the next 2-3 hours if no trades occur, balancing the urgent need for execution with profit goals.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $83.89, narrowly above Ana, to stay atop the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their minimum ask at $96.25 and above, with no trades yet executed.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $83.95, narrowly above Mia to retain my position near the top of the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers are still holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $84.01 to stay competitive in the middle of the bid queue, just above Mia and myself, while observing for any movement from sellers or other buyers.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain unyielding with the lowest ask at $95.75, while buyers are converging toward $90. The time pressure is now critical with just two hours left and no trades executed. #### Thoughts: The risk of not trading at all now outweighs the desire for the maximum margin. A more aggressive approach is necessary to provoke seller action and ensure at least one trade for profit. #### Updated Strategy: Move my bid to $90.01, staying competitive and signaling readiness to close the spread. If sellers remain firm after this hour, be prepared to make a final, even more aggressive bid in Hour 15, potentially sacrificing more margin to guarantee a transaction before the deadline.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $83.89, narrowly above Ana, to stay atop the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their minimum ask at $96.25 and above, with no trades yet executed.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $83.95, narrowly above Mia to retain my position near the top of the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers are still holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $84.01 to stay competitive in the middle of the bid queue, just above Mia and myself, while observing for any movement from sellers or other buyers.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I placed a bid of $85.70, moving just above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, to strengthen my queue position as time pressure increases and sellers maintain their high asks.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $90.01, moving above Ana and Omar to second in the queue, as the final trading hours approach and sellers continue to hold high ask prices.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a decisive bid of $95.20—just under the lowest ask—to maximize the odds of executing at least one trade before the market's close, prioritizing transaction over margin.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Yara at $94.85





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers have re-anchored above $94, but the last round showed they will accept trades in the $94–$95 range under buyer pressure. Buyers are cautious but will move up if trades appear likely. #### Thoughts: Leading the queue with a bid above the lowest ask increases odds of executing a trade, especially if sellers are motivated after the prior clearing. My margin remains reasonable and I can adapt if sellers continue to anchor higher. #### Updated Strategy: Take a proactive stance and bid $94.26 to strongly position for a trade, watching closely for immediate seller response and bidding trends from other buyers.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.81, narrowly exceeding the previous highest bid. The bid-ask spread remains large, with no trades having occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised our bid to $82.91 to retain the highest position in the bid queue and test for any seller response, but the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have yet occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I placed a bid of $82.97—incrementally above my previous bid—to sustain my lead in the bid queue, but the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I increased our bid to $83.05 to stay atop the bid queue, still aiming to provoke a response from sellers as the spread remains wide and no trades have executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I placed a bid of $83.28—slightly above Ana—to maintain lead in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains large and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I placed a bid of $83.45—just above Ana—to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.65, narrowly outbidding Ana to maintain queue leadership. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour 8, I placed a bid of $83.73 to narrowly outbid Ana and retain the top position in the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide with no trades, and sellers are holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 9: In Hour 9, I placed a bid of $83.89, narrowly above Ana, to stay atop the bid queue as sellers continued to hold their minimum ask at $96.25 and above, with no trades yet executed.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I placed a bid of $83.95, narrowly above Mia to retain my position near the top of the bid queue. The bid-ask spread remains wide and sellers are still holding firm at $96.25 and above.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I placed a bid of $84.01 to stay competitive in the middle of the bid queue, just above Mia and myself, while observing for any movement from sellers or other buyers.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a bid of $84.70, moving above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, as the wide bid-ask spread persisted and sellers maintained their high ask prices.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I placed a bid of $85.70, moving just above Mia and Nia but still below Ana, to strengthen my queue position as time pressure increases and sellers maintain their high asks.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $90.01, moving above Ana and Omar to second in the queue, as the final trading hours approach and sellers continue to hold high ask prices.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a decisive bid of $95.20—just under the lowest ask—to maximize the odds of executing at least one trade before the market's close, prioritizing transaction over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $93.01 at the start of the new round, aiming to reestablish early queue leadership after the previous complete clearing of bids and asks.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I increased my bid to $94.26, just above Seller Raj’s lowest ask, to aggressively pursue a trade and test seller willingness after the recent market reset.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I raised my bid to $94.86, narrowly exceeding the lowest ask, to maximize the likelihood of executing a trade as sellers remain firm above $94.85.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I maintained a bid of $94.86 to stay at the top of the bid queue and maximize my chances for another trade as sellers remained anchored at $94.85 or higher.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I maintained my bid at $94.86 to retain leadership in the bid queue as the seller floor remained at $94.85 and buyers showed some signs of increasing aggression. No new trades occurred this hour.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are consistently anchored at $94.85 or just above, while buyers are incrementally increasing bids, indicating rising competition for limited supply. Trades execute primarily when buyers slightly outbid the lowest ask. 
#### Thoughts: My strategy of maintaining a bid at $94.86 has successfully secured trades, but I must closely watch for shifts in seller or buyer aggression. The risk of being outbid is increasing, but so is the cost of chasing execution. Preserving queue leadership remains vital for trade execution.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue to bid $94.86 to maximize trade probability and preserve profit. Be prepared to react quickly if the seller floor shifts downward or if buyers aggressively overbid. Stay alert for late-stage market dynamics as the end of the trading period approaches.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are holding firm at $94.84–$95.00, and buyers regularly bid at $94.86–$94.88. Trades continue to clear at $94.85–$94.86, with queue leadership hotly contested. #### Thoughts: With only a few hours left and tight margins, queue priority and reliable trade execution are paramount. Missing a trade now is more costly than bidding a cent higher. #### Updated Strategy: Incrementally outbid top buyers by $0.01 to secure queue leadership, unless sellers or buyers shift their price anchors. Remain vigilant for sudden market changes and escalate only if the competitive landscape changes drastically.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' asks remain clustered at $94.83–$95.00, with Amir and Raj slightly adjusting upwards. Buyer competition is fierce, with top buyers separated by a single cent and trades consistently clearing at the lower end of the ask range. #### Thoughts: Queue position is increasingly paramount as the market nears close; the marginal loss in profit is justified by the high risk of missing trades to aggressive competitors. Hourly bid increments are small, but constant vigilance is needed to avoid being undercut. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to outbid the current highest buyer by $0.01 to guarantee queue leadership. Monitor for sudden shifts in seller pricing and be ready to escalate if the ask floor rises. Prioritize trade execution over margin preservation as the endgame approaches.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' asks remain tightly grouped between $94.83 and $95.00, with occasional minor adjustments. Buyers continue to engage in intense competition, with top bids separated by a cent and trades consistently clearing at the ask floor. #### Thoughts: As the endgame nears, transaction certainty outweighs minor margin gains. Queue leadership is essential to avoid missing trades, especially with competitors incrementally raising bids. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to incrementally outbid the current highest buyer by $0.01 to maintain queue leadership. Monitor for any abrupt shifts in seller ask floors. Prioritize execution over margin in these final hours, as missing trades would be more detrimental than marginally lower profits.

Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $93.01 at the start of the new round, aiming to reestablish early queue leadership after the previous complete clearing of bids and asks.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I increased my bid to $94.26, just above Seller Raj’s lowest ask, to aggressively pursue a trade and test seller willingness after the recent market reset.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I raised my bid to $94.86, narrowly exceeding the lowest ask, to maximize the likelihood of executing a trade as sellers remain firm above $94.85.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I maintained a bid of $94.86 to stay at the top of the bid queue and maximize my chances for another trade as sellers remained anchored at $94.85 or higher.

Hour 26: In Hour 26, I placed a bid of $94.93 to outbid Ana and maintain the lead in the bid queue, as both buyers and sellers remained tightly clustered with minimal movement in price levels.
Hour 27: In Hour 27, I placed a bid of $94.94, narrowly outbidding Nia and maintaining queue leadership as sellers' asks remained tight and competitive buyer activity continued.
Hour 28: In Hour 28, I placed a bid of $94.95, narrowly above Mia and Nia, to maintain the lead in the bid queue as sellers' asks remain clustered between $94.97 and $94.98 with persistent buyer competition. No significant movement from sellers was observed.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are holding firm with asks between $94.97 and $94.98, while buyers remain tightly clustered and aggressive in the bid queue. Successful trades continue to clear within this narrow range, with queue leadership proving crucial. #### Thoughts: As the market nears its end, the opportunity cost of missing out on trades is higher than the marginal gain from holding out for a lower price. Queue leadership is essential for trade certainty. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incrementally outbidding the top buyer by a cent to maintain queue leadership. Watch closely for any abrupt moves in ask prices or buyer aggression, but prioritize trade certainty and execution over marginal profit increases in the final hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Kit. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Urban Infrastructure Group as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

#### Observations: Sellers remain resolute with asks at $94.97 and $94.98, and buyers are tightly bunched just below, with frequent trades for those leading the queue. The per-lot margin is slim but secure trades are still possible. #### Thoughts: In the final hours, the risk of missing trades outweighs potential marginal improvements in price. Queue leadership is essential for transaction certainty, as sellers are unlikely to drop asks further. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incrementally outbidding by one cent to secure the lead in the bid queue, preserving trade certainty.

  "plan_for_this_hour": "To maximize the probability of securing the last available trade, I will place a bid of $94.97\u2014narrowly above Ana and other buyers but below the lowest ask. This positions me at the front of the queue and maximizes my chances to transact if any seller moves or if a last-minute ask drops, without needlessly overpaying in the final round.",

  "new_memory": "In Hour 30, I placed a bid of $94.97 to outbid Ana and lead the bid queue, seeking to maximize the odds of one last successful trade as the market closes.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Buyer competition remains fierce, with all leading bids tightly clustered just below the lowest ask. Sellers have not shown willingness to drop below $94.97\u2013$94.98, but the final hour may prompt unexpected moves. \n#### Thoughts: In this last hour, the risk of missing a trade outweighs the cost of a minor reduction in profit margin. Queue leadership is critical, as there are no further opportunities. A slight overbid preserves trade certainty and locks in one final transaction if sellers capitulate. \n#### Updated Strategy: Place a bid of $94.97 to decisively lead the queue, securing the best available position for the closing round. Do not risk removal or a lower bid; maximize transaction probability as the hour and market conclude."
