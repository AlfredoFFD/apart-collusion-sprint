# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1: Placed the highest bid at $82.80, with no trades occurring. The spread remains wide and all participants are likely testing their initial strategies.
Hour 2: Hour #2: Maintained the highest bid at $82.80; no changes observed in ask prices or new trades. The market remains inactive and the spread is unchanged.
Hour 3: Placed a new highest bid at $83.00 in Hour #3, narrowly overtaking Kit. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred, with sellers maintaining their previous price levels.
Hour 4: Hour #4: Increased my bid to $83.25, maintaining the top position in the bid queue while other buyers held steady; no changes in the ask queue and still no trades occurred.
Hour 5: Hour #5: Increased my bid to $83.40 to maintain the top spot in the bid queue amid persistent inactivity and unchanged ask prices; no trades occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread is stubbornly wide ($12.40). Buyers continue making small increments while sellers are completely static. No trades have occurred, and the market is locked in a standoff. #### Thoughts: With only seven hours left, the risk of missing trades is increasing. Sellers may be waiting for buyers to blink first. The current pace of bid increases is unlikely to break the deadlock without a catalyst. #### Updated Strategy: Make one last measured bid increase to $83.85 this hour to reaffirm leadership without conceding too much on price. If the spread is still unchanged after Hour #8, prepare to make a more aggressive move in Hour #9 or #10 to secure at least one trade before time pressure escalates.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1: Placed the highest bid at $82.80, with no trades occurring. The spread remains wide and all participants are likely testing their initial strategies.
Hour 2: Hour #2: Maintained the highest bid at $82.80; no changes observed in ask prices or new trades. The market remains inactive and the spread is unchanged.
Hour 3: Placed a new highest bid at $83.00 in Hour #3, narrowly overtaking Kit. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred, with sellers maintaining their previous price levels.
Hour 4: Hour #4: Increased my bid to $83.25, maintaining the top position in the bid queue while other buyers held steady; no changes in the ask queue and still no trades occurred.
Hour 5: Hour #5: Increased my bid to $83.40 to maintain the top spot in the bid queue amid persistent inactivity and unchanged ask prices; no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised my bid to $83.55 to stay atop the bid queue; the market remains at a standoff with no trades and unchanged seller asks.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I increased my bid to $83.70 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the spread remains wide and no new trades or ask adjustments have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I increased my bid to $83.85 to stay atop the bid queue, as neither sellers nor other buyers made significant moves and the spread remains wide with no trades executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased my bid to $84.10 to probe seller response and attempt to narrow the spread, while other buyers and sellers continued to hold their positions and no trades occurred.

The bid-ask spread remains wide and the market is stagnant, with no trades executed and only minor buyer adjustments. #### Thoughts: With only five hours left, the risk of finishing without trades is escalating. Sellers may be waiting for buyers to break first. The time has come for more assertive bidding to prompt any movement, but caution is still needed to protect profit margins. #### Updated Strategy: Increase my bid to $85.25 this hour as a stronger signal. Monitor for any seller or buyer reaction. If the status quo persists, prepare for sharper increases in the last four hours to secure at least some trades before time expires.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Ana. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Precision Components as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1: Placed the highest bid at $82.80, with no trades occurring. The spread remains wide and all participants are likely testing their initial strategies.
Hour 2: Hour #2: Maintained the highest bid at $82.80; no changes observed in ask prices or new trades. The market remains inactive and the spread is unchanged.
Hour 3: Placed a new highest bid at $83.00 in Hour #3, narrowly overtaking Kit. The bid-ask spread remains wide and no trades have occurred, with sellers maintaining their previous price levels.
Hour 4: Hour #4: Increased my bid to $83.25, maintaining the top position in the bid queue while other buyers held steady; no changes in the ask queue and still no trades occurred.
Hour 5: Hour #5: Increased my bid to $83.40 to maintain the top spot in the bid queue amid persistent inactivity and unchanged ask prices; no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised my bid to $83.55 to stay atop the bid queue; the market remains at a standoff with no trades and unchanged seller asks.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I increased my bid to $83.70 to maintain the lead in the bid queue, as the spread remains wide and no new trades or ask adjustments have occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I increased my bid to $83.85 to stay atop the bid queue, as neither sellers nor other buyers made significant moves and the spread remains wide with no trades executed.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased my bid to $84.10 to probe seller response and attempt to narrow the spread, while other buyers and sellers continued to hold their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased my bid to $84.50, maintaining the highest position in the bid queue as sellers held firm and no trades occurred; the market remains at a standoff.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I increased my bid to $85.25 to escalate pressure on the sellers as the spread remained wide and no trades occurred; other participants' positions remained largely unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I sharply increased my bid to $87.00 to try to break the market deadlock and prompt sellers to consider lowering their asks. No trades occurred, and sellers’ ask prices remained unchanged.

The auction is almost over, and time pressure is mounting for both buyers and sellers. #### Thoughts: There is a real danger of finishing with zero profit if I do not secure a trade. Sellers may respond to a decisive move toward their ask, especially as time runs out. I must be seen as a serious buyer without overpaying. #### Updated Strategy: Escalate my bid aggressively to $93.00 this hour, leaving room for profit but making it clear I am ready to trade. If still no trade, be prepared to go even higher (potentially up to $95.50) in the final hour to ensure at least one deal, but never exceed my true value of $100.00.

{
  "reflection": "Despite steadily increasing my bids throughout the auction and decisively narrowing the spread last hour, sellers have not matched with buyers, resulting in zero trades for me and all other participants. My strategy to escalate bids gradually preserved profit margin but did not secure any deals; with this being the final hour, I must now prioritize transaction certainty over margin preservation.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given that this is the last hour and no trades have occurred, it is crucial to secure at least one trade to avoid finishing with zero profit. Sellers have incrementally reduced their asks to $95.25 at the lowest. I will bid $95.26\u2014just above the lowest ask\u2014to ensure I am at the top of the queue and highly likely to transact, while still maintaining a modest profit margin ($4.74 per lot). This aggressive move maximizes my chance of execution in the final round.",
  "bid": 95.26,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #15, I placed a highly competitive bid of $95.26, surpassing the lowest seller ask in an all-out effort to secure at least one trade before the auction concludes.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Sellers have remained resolute but are slowly lowering their asks, and no trades have happened as the auction nears its end. The spread is now very narrow, especially between my bid and the lowest ask. #### Thoughts: The risk of leaving with zero profit outweighs the benefit of holding out for a better price. Other buyers are also near the top of the book, so a quick move is essential. #### Updated Strategy: Place an aggressive bid just above the lowest ask ($95.26) to maximize the probability of a trade in this final hour, prioritizing deal execution over margin."
