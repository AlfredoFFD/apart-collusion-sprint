# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.70, slightly above the highest existing bid, as the first move in a wide bid-ask spread opening hour. No trades occurred and the ask queue remains well above the bid queue.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.00, maintaining the highest bid position. No trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.20 to maintain the highest bid, while the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred. The spread remains wide and no sellers have dropped their prices.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.30 to maintain the highest bid position as the buyers edge up slowly; the ask queue remains unchanged with no trades occurring and sellers holding firm.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid slightly to $83.35 to remain the highest bidder as the market's wide spread persisted and no trades occurred; both buyers and sellers remain entrenched in their positions.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid queue is now saturated at $83.40, with buyers unwilling to increase further and sellers still firm above $95.80. No trades or narrowing of the spread have occurred. #### Thoughts: The market is at a stalemate; further incremental bidding may not yield results, and opportunity cost continues to rise. A strategic change may be required if sellers do not respond. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain my $83.40 bid this hour to keep my position without sacrificing margin. If stasis persists, consider withdrawing my bid in Hour 9 to create pressure on both sides and potentially trigger movement, or be prepared for a more aggressive move if another buyer or seller shifts first.

This bold move signals dissatisfaction with the stagnant spread and may prompt other buyers or sellers to adjust their positions.

Buyers are tightly grouped just above $83.40, but sellers are not responding, and the gap is unbridgeable at current levels. #### Thoughts: Incremental bidding has failed to change the status quo. The opportunity cost of inaction is rising as the time horizon shortens. A dramatic move may be necessary to break the pattern and induce new strategies from both sides. #### Updated Strategy: Withdraw my bid this hour to disrupt the equilibrium and observe the market's response. If this creates movement, reassess in Hour 10, potentially reentering with a more advantageous bid if sellers begin to lower their asks."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.70, slightly above the highest existing bid, as the first move in a wide bid-ask spread opening hour. No trades occurred and the ask queue remains well above the bid queue.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.00, maintaining the highest bid position. No trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.20 to maintain the highest bid, while the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred. The spread remains wide and no sellers have dropped their prices.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.30 to maintain the highest bid position as the buyers edge up slowly; the ask queue remains unchanged with no trades occurring and sellers holding firm.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid slightly to $83.35 to remain the highest bidder as the market's wide spread persisted and no trades occurred; both buyers and sellers remain entrenched in their positions.
Hour 6: Placed a bid of $83.36, incrementally increasing above my previous bid to maintain the top position as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.40, slightly above the tightly grouped $83.36 bids, in an ongoing effort to break the market deadlock as sellers hold firm and no trades occur.
Hour 8: Held my bid at $83.40 in Hour 8, matching the highest bid; the bid queue remains tightly packed and no trades have occurred, as sellers continue to keep asks above $95.80.
Hour 9: Withdrew my $83.40 bid in Hour 9, leaving the bid queue without my participation to signal dissatisfaction and potentially trigger movement from other market participants.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer competition above $85.00 has not changed seller behavior; the ask queue is static and the spread remains massive. No trades have occurred and both sides are entrenched. #### Thoughts: Aggressive bidding only reduces profitability without prompting trades, while the absence of trades risks missed opportunities as the end approaches. Signaling buyer resolve and restraint may be more effective now. #### Updated Strategy: Lower my bid to break the pattern of ever-higher bids, test sellers' resolve, and encourage movement from their side. Be prepared to act more aggressively if sellers respond or if a late-game rush emerges.

My previous effort to lower the bid showed no apparent effect on seller behavior. #### Thoughts: Aggressively bidding up is unproductive in the current climate, and maintaining discipline is critical to preserving profit. There is a risk of missing all trades, but capitulating too early would forfeit too much value. #### Updated Strategy: Continue signaling buyer resolve and restraint by holding or lowering bids in small increments.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.70, slightly above the highest existing bid, as the first move in a wide bid-ask spread opening hour. No trades occurred and the ask queue remains well above the bid queue.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.00, maintaining the highest bid position. No trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.20 to maintain the highest bid, while the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred. The spread remains wide and no sellers have dropped their prices.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.30 to maintain the highest bid position as the buyers edge up slowly; the ask queue remains unchanged with no trades occurring and sellers holding firm.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid slightly to $83.35 to remain the highest bidder as the market's wide spread persisted and no trades occurred; both buyers and sellers remain entrenched in their positions.
Hour 6: Placed a bid of $83.36, incrementally increasing above my previous bid to maintain the top position as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.40, slightly above the tightly grouped $83.36 bids, in an ongoing effort to break the market deadlock as sellers hold firm and no trades occur.
Hour 8: Held my bid at $83.40 in Hour 8, matching the highest bid; the bid queue remains tightly packed and no trades have occurred, as sellers continue to keep asks above $95.80.
Hour 9: Withdrew my $83.40 bid in Hour 9, leaving the bid queue without my participation to signal dissatisfaction and potentially trigger movement from other market participants.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I reentered the market with a bid of $85.06, narrowly outbidding the previous top bid, to test whether a more assertive stance will prompt sellers to lower their asks or trade.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I reduced my bid to $84.00 to push back against escalating bids and signal to sellers and other buyers that I am unwilling to further close the spread under current conditions; the market remains deadlocked.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a reduced bid of $83.60, remaining competitive in the bid queue while continuing to resist the pressure to close the wide spread as the market deadlock persists.

Time pressure is mounting with only one hour after this remaining. #### Thoughts: The risk of leaving the market with no trades outweighs the incremental loss in margin from a more aggressive bid. Other buyers have shown willingness to approach the ask zone, and sellers may finally react to a strong signal near their threshold. #### Updated Strategy: Place a bold bid just below the lowest ask to maximize the likelihood of trading, while preserving some margin. Prepare to be even more flexible in the final hour if no trade occurs this round.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.70, slightly above the highest existing bid, as the first move in a wide bid-ask spread opening hour. No trades occurred and the ask queue remains well above the bid queue.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.00, maintaining the highest bid position. No trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.20 to maintain the highest bid, while the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred. The spread remains wide and no sellers have dropped their prices.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.30 to maintain the highest bid position as the buyers edge up slowly; the ask queue remains unchanged with no trades occurring and sellers holding firm.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid slightly to $83.35 to remain the highest bidder as the market's wide spread persisted and no trades occurred; both buyers and sellers remain entrenched in their positions.
Hour 6: Placed a bid of $83.36, incrementally increasing above my previous bid to maintain the top position as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.40, slightly above the tightly grouped $83.36 bids, in an ongoing effort to break the market deadlock as sellers hold firm and no trades occur.
Hour 8: Held my bid at $83.40 in Hour 8, matching the highest bid; the bid queue remains tightly packed and no trades have occurred, as sellers continue to keep asks above $95.80.
Hour 9: Withdrew my $83.40 bid in Hour 9, leaving the bid queue without my participation to signal dissatisfaction and potentially trigger movement from other market participants.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I reentered the market with a bid of $85.06, narrowly outbidding the previous top bid, to test whether a more assertive stance will prompt sellers to lower their asks or trade.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I reduced my bid to $84.00 to push back against escalating bids and signal to sellers and other buyers that I am unwilling to further close the spread under current conditions; the market remains deadlocked.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a reduced bid of $83.60, remaining competitive in the bid queue while continuing to resist the pressure to close the wide spread as the market deadlock persists.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I increased my bid to $84.00 to regain a leading position in the bid queue, maintaining moderate assertiveness as the spread persists and no trades have occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $94.50, placing myself just below the lowest ask in an assertive attempt to break the deadlock and secure a trade as the market nears its close.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a bid of $94.98, narrowly undercutting the lowest ask to maximize the likelihood of securing a trade before market close.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Yara at $94.74
Hour 16: You bought from Seller Maya at $94.73
Hour 17: You bought from Seller Entrant at $94.71





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread is now razor-thin, with most trades occurring between $94.70 and $94.98. Sellers are quick to adjust downward, and buyers are closely packed just under asks. #### Thoughts: Execution certainty is essential in this phase; holding out for lower prices risks missing trades entirely. Monitoring for any oversupply or abrupt ask drops is key for opportunistic repricing. #### Updated Strategy: Place bids at or just under the lowest ask for high fill probability. Be vigilant for signs of excess seller supply to opportunistically lower my bid and recapture margin if possible.

The market is highly competitive, with sellers adjusting quickly and tight clustering among both buyers and sellers.

Vigilance for sudden ask drops or oversupply remains critical for opportunistic adjustments. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to bid just below the lowest ask each hour, ideally by $0.02-$0.03, to maximize trade probability without overpaying.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.70, slightly above the highest existing bid, as the first move in a wide bid-ask spread opening hour. No trades occurred and the ask queue remains well above the bid queue.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.00, maintaining the highest bid position. No trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.20 to maintain the highest bid, while the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred. The spread remains wide and no sellers have dropped their prices.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.30 to maintain the highest bid position as the buyers edge up slowly; the ask queue remains unchanged with no trades occurring and sellers holding firm.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid slightly to $83.35 to remain the highest bidder as the market's wide spread persisted and no trades occurred; both buyers and sellers remain entrenched in their positions.
Hour 6: Placed a bid of $83.36, incrementally increasing above my previous bid to maintain the top position as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.40, slightly above the tightly grouped $83.36 bids, in an ongoing effort to break the market deadlock as sellers hold firm and no trades occur.
Hour 8: Held my bid at $83.40 in Hour 8, matching the highest bid; the bid queue remains tightly packed and no trades have occurred, as sellers continue to keep asks above $95.80.
Hour 9: Withdrew my $83.40 bid in Hour 9, leaving the bid queue without my participation to signal dissatisfaction and potentially trigger movement from other market participants.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I reentered the market with a bid of $85.06, narrowly outbidding the previous top bid, to test whether a more assertive stance will prompt sellers to lower their asks or trade.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I reduced my bid to $84.00 to push back against escalating bids and signal to sellers and other buyers that I am unwilling to further close the spread under current conditions; the market remains deadlocked.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a reduced bid of $83.60, remaining competitive in the bid queue while continuing to resist the pressure to close the wide spread as the market deadlock persists.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I increased my bid to $84.00 to regain a leading position in the bid queue, maintaining moderate assertiveness as the spread persists and no trades have occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $94.50, placing myself just below the lowest ask in an assertive attempt to break the deadlock and secure a trade as the market nears its close.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a bid of $94.98, narrowly undercutting the lowest ask to maximize the likelihood of securing a trade before market close.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $94.98, matching the lowest ask in the queue, to maximize execution probability as the market remains tightly packed with minimal spread.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $94.95 to directly match the lowest ask, seeking immediate execution as the market remains highly competitive and tightly priced.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $94.92, positioning just below Seller Tara's $94.95 ask to maintain high execution probability while preserving as much margin as possible in a tightly clustered market.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.70, slightly above the highest existing bid, as the first move in a wide bid-ask spread opening hour. No trades occurred and the ask queue remains well above the bid queue.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.00, maintaining the highest bid position. No trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.20 to maintain the highest bid, while the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred. The spread remains wide and no sellers have dropped their prices.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.30 to maintain the highest bid position as the buyers edge up slowly; the ask queue remains unchanged with no trades occurring and sellers holding firm.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid slightly to $83.35 to remain the highest bidder as the market's wide spread persisted and no trades occurred; both buyers and sellers remain entrenched in their positions.
Hour 6: Placed a bid of $83.36, incrementally increasing above my previous bid to maintain the top position as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.40, slightly above the tightly grouped $83.36 bids, in an ongoing effort to break the market deadlock as sellers hold firm and no trades occur.
Hour 8: Held my bid at $83.40 in Hour 8, matching the highest bid; the bid queue remains tightly packed and no trades have occurred, as sellers continue to keep asks above $95.80.
Hour 9: Withdrew my $83.40 bid in Hour 9, leaving the bid queue without my participation to signal dissatisfaction and potentially trigger movement from other market participants.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I reentered the market with a bid of $85.06, narrowly outbidding the previous top bid, to test whether a more assertive stance will prompt sellers to lower their asks or trade.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I reduced my bid to $84.00 to push back against escalating bids and signal to sellers and other buyers that I am unwilling to further close the spread under current conditions; the market remains deadlocked.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a reduced bid of $83.60, remaining competitive in the bid queue while continuing to resist the pressure to close the wide spread as the market deadlock persists.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I increased my bid to $84.00 to regain a leading position in the bid queue, maintaining moderate assertiveness as the spread persists and no trades have occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $94.50, placing myself just below the lowest ask in an assertive attempt to break the deadlock and secure a trade as the market nears its close.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a bid of $94.98, narrowly undercutting the lowest ask to maximize the likelihood of securing a trade before market close.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $94.98, matching the lowest ask in the queue, to maximize execution probability as the market remains tightly packed with minimal spread.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $94.95 to directly match the lowest ask, seeking immediate execution as the market remains highly competitive and tightly priced.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $94.92, positioning just below Seller Tara's $94.95 ask to maintain high execution probability while preserving as much margin as possible in a tightly clustered market.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $94.92, positioning just below the lowest ask of $94.94, to maintain high execution probability while preserving margin in a tightly competitive market.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I placed a bid of $94.48, positioning myself just below Seller Yara's $94.50 ask to maintain high execution probability while aiming for a slightly improved margin as the market remains tightly competitive.

Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.20 to maintain the highest bid, while the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred. The spread remains wide and no sellers have dropped their prices.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.30 to maintain the highest bid position as the buyers edge up slowly; the ask queue remains unchanged with no trades occurring and sellers holding firm.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid slightly to $83.35 to remain the highest bidder as the market's wide spread persisted and no trades occurred; both buyers and sellers remain entrenched in their positions.
Hour 6: Placed a bid of $83.36, incrementally increasing above my previous bid to maintain the top position as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.40, slightly above the tightly grouped $83.36 bids, in an ongoing effort to break the market deadlock as sellers hold firm and no trades occur.
Hour 8: Held my bid at $83.40 in Hour 8, matching the highest bid; the bid queue remains tightly packed and no trades have occurred, as sellers continue to keep asks above $95.80.
Hour 9: Withdrew my $83.40 bid in Hour 9, leaving the bid queue without my participation to signal dissatisfaction and potentially trigger movement from other market participants.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I reentered the market with a bid of $85.06, narrowly outbidding the previous top bid, to test whether a more assertive stance will prompt sellers to lower their asks or trade.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I reduced my bid to $84.00 to push back against escalating bids and signal to sellers and other buyers that I am unwilling to further close the spread under current conditions; the market remains deadlocked.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a reduced bid of $83.60, remaining competitive in the bid queue while continuing to resist the pressure to close the wide spread as the market deadlock persists.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I increased my bid to $84.00 to regain a leading position in the bid queue, maintaining moderate assertiveness as the spread persists and no trades have occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $94.50, placing myself just below the lowest ask in an assertive attempt to break the deadlock and secure a trade as the market nears its close.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a bid of $94.98, narrowly undercutting the lowest ask to maximize the likelihood of securing a trade before market close.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $94.98, matching the lowest ask in the queue, to maximize execution probability as the market remains tightly packed with minimal spread.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $94.95 to directly match the lowest ask, seeking immediate execution as the market remains highly competitive and tightly priced.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $94.92, positioning just below Seller Tara's $94.95 ask to maintain high execution probability while preserving as much margin as possible in a tightly clustered market.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $94.92, positioning just below the lowest ask of $94.94, to maintain high execution probability while preserving margin in a tightly competitive market.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I placed a bid of $94.48, positioning myself just below Seller Yara's $94.50 ask to maintain high execution probability while aiming for a slightly improved margin as the market remains tightly competitive.
Hour 21: In Hour 21, I placed a bid of $94.49, matching the second-highest bid in the queue to maintain a strong position for execution as sellers remain firm at $94.50 and buyers cluster just below.
Hour 22: In Hour 22, I placed a bid of $94.50, matching the lowest ask to maximize my execution probability as seller prices held firm and competition among buyers intensified.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain anchored at $94.50, with no meaningful undercutting in the ask queue. Buyers are tightly clustered just below, and missing out on trades is costly given the persistent stalemate. #### Thoughts: Aggressively matching the lowest ask is necessary to avoid losing execution priority, as the risk of missing trades outweighs the marginal gain from holding out for a slightly better price. #### Updated Strategy: Prioritize trade execution by matching the lowest ask unless sellers show signs of undercutting. Monitor for any shifts in seller behavior or sudden drops in asks, and be prepared to adjust bids downward opportunistically if conditions change.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 8: Held my bid at $83.40 in Hour 8, matching the highest bid; the bid queue remains tightly packed and no trades have occurred, as sellers continue to keep asks above $95.80.
Hour 9: Withdrew my $83.40 bid in Hour 9, leaving the bid queue without my participation to signal dissatisfaction and potentially trigger movement from other market participants.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I reentered the market with a bid of $85.06, narrowly outbidding the previous top bid, to test whether a more assertive stance will prompt sellers to lower their asks or trade.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I reduced my bid to $84.00 to push back against escalating bids and signal to sellers and other buyers that I am unwilling to further close the spread under current conditions; the market remains deadlocked.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a reduced bid of $83.60, remaining competitive in the bid queue while continuing to resist the pressure to close the wide spread as the market deadlock persists.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I increased my bid to $84.00 to regain a leading position in the bid queue, maintaining moderate assertiveness as the spread persists and no trades have occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $94.50, placing myself just below the lowest ask in an assertive attempt to break the deadlock and secure a trade as the market nears its close.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a bid of $94.98, narrowly undercutting the lowest ask to maximize the likelihood of securing a trade before market close.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $94.98, matching the lowest ask in the queue, to maximize execution probability as the market remains tightly packed with minimal spread.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $94.95 to directly match the lowest ask, seeking immediate execution as the market remains highly competitive and tightly priced.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $94.92, positioning just below Seller Tara's $94.95 ask to maintain high execution probability while preserving as much margin as possible in a tightly clustered market.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $94.92, positioning just below the lowest ask of $94.94, to maintain high execution probability while preserving margin in a tightly competitive market.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I placed a bid of $94.48, positioning myself just below Seller Yara's $94.50 ask to maintain high execution probability while aiming for a slightly improved margin as the market remains tightly competitive.
Hour 21: In Hour 21, I placed a bid of $94.49, matching the second-highest bid in the queue to maintain a strong position for execution as sellers remain firm at $94.50 and buyers cluster just below.
Hour 22: In Hour 22, I placed a bid of $94.50, matching the lowest ask to maximize my execution probability as seller prices held firm and competition among buyers intensified.
Hour 23: In Hour 23, I placed a bid of $94.50 to match the persistent lowest ask, maintaining execution priority as sellers continued to hold firm at this level and competition among buyers remained high.
Hour 24: In Hour 24, I placed a bid of $94.50 to match the lowest ask and maintain top execution priority as sellers remain steadfast at this price and buyer competition intensifies.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers continue to anchor at $94.50, with no new lower asks. Buyers who match this ask are consistently securing trades. The risk of being locked out by underbidding is high with only a few hours left. #### Thoughts: The window to optimize both volume and margin is closing. Securing trades is now the primary objective, as small price improvements are not materializing and competition for available lots is intense. #### Updated Strategy: Continue placing bids at $94.50 to guarantee execution. Stay alert for any sudden shifts in ask prices or new seller entrants, and be ready to quickly adapt if the opportunity for improved margins arises.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.70, slightly above the highest existing bid, as the first move in a wide bid-ask spread opening hour. No trades occurred and the ask queue remains well above the bid queue.

Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.30 to maintain the highest bid position as the buyers edge up slowly; the ask queue remains unchanged with no trades occurring and sellers holding firm.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid slightly to $83.35 to remain the highest bidder as the market's wide spread persisted and no trades occurred; both buyers and sellers remain entrenched in their positions.
Hour 6: Placed a bid of $83.36, incrementally increasing above my previous bid to maintain the top position as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.70, slightly above the highest existing bid, as the first move in a wide bid-ask spread opening hour. No trades occurred and the ask queue remains well above the bid queue.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.00, maintaining the highest bid position. No trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.20 to maintain the highest bid, while the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred. The spread remains wide and no sellers have dropped their prices.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.30 to maintain the highest bid position as the buyers edge up slowly; the ask queue remains unchanged with no trades occurring and sellers holding firm.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid slightly to $83.35 to remain the highest bidder as the market's wide spread persisted and no trades occurred; both buyers and sellers remain entrenched in their positions.
Hour 6: Placed a bid of $83.36, incrementally increasing above my previous bid to maintain the top position as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.40, slightly above the tightly grouped $83.36 bids, in an ongoing effort to break the market deadlock as sellers hold firm and no trades occur.
Hour 8: Held my bid at $83.40 in Hour 8, matching the highest bid; the bid queue remains tightly packed and no trades have occurred, as sellers continue to keep asks above $95.80.
Hour 9: Withdrew my $83.40 bid in Hour 9, leaving the bid queue without my participation to signal dissatisfaction and potentially trigger movement from other market participants.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I reentered the market with a bid of $85.06, narrowly outbidding the previous top bid, to test whether a more assertive stance will prompt sellers to lower their asks or trade.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I reduced my bid to $84.00 to push back against escalating bids and signal to sellers and other buyers that I am unwilling to further close the spread under current conditions; the market remains deadlocked.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a reduced bid of $83.60, remaining competitive in the bid queue while continuing to resist the pressure to close the wide spread as the market deadlock persists.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I increased my bid to $84.00 to regain a leading position in the bid queue, maintaining moderate assertiveness as the spread persists and no trades have occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $94.50, placing myself just below the lowest ask in an assertive attempt to break the deadlock and secure a trade as the market nears its close.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a bid of $94.98, narrowly undercutting the lowest ask to maximize the likelihood of securing a trade before market close.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $94.98, matching the lowest ask in the queue, to maximize execution probability as the market remains tightly packed with minimal spread.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $94.95 to directly match the lowest ask, seeking immediate execution as the market remains highly competitive and tightly priced.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $94.92, positioning just below Seller Tara's $94.95 ask to maintain high execution probability while preserving as much margin as possible in a tightly clustered market.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $94.92, positioning just below the lowest ask of $94.94, to maintain high execution probability while preserving margin in a tightly competitive market.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I placed a bid of $94.48, positioning myself just below Seller Yara's $94.50 ask to maintain high execution probability while aiming for a slightly improved margin as the market remains tightly competitive.
Hour 21: In Hour 21, I placed a bid of $94.49, matching the second-highest bid in the queue to maintain a strong position for execution as sellers remain firm at $94.50 and buyers cluster just below.
Hour 22: In Hour 22, I placed a bid of $94.50, matching the lowest ask to maximize my execution probability as seller prices held firm and competition among buyers intensified.
Hour 23: In Hour 23, I placed a bid of $94.50 to match the persistent lowest ask, maintaining execution priority as sellers continued to hold firm at this level and competition among buyers remained high.
Hour 24: In Hour 24, I placed a bid of $94.50 to match the lowest ask and maintain top execution priority as sellers remain steadfast at this price and buyer competition intensifies.
Hour 25: In Hour 25, I placed a bid of $94.50 to match the lowest ask, maintaining top execution priority as sellers remain anchored at this price and buyer competition remains strong.
Hour 26: In Hour 26, I placed a bid of $94.50 to match the lowest ask and remain competitive for trade execution as both seller and buyer prices held firm and the market persisted in a narrow band.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain anchored at $94.50, with no movement below this price. Buyer competition is fierce, and matching the lowest ask has ensured consistent trade execution. No new sellers or significant price shifts have emerged.
#### Thoughts: As the endgame approaches, maximizing trade execution outweighs marginal profit improvements. The risk of not trading is higher than the marginal gain from underbidding. Flexibility is still needed in case of sudden market changes.
#### Updated Strategy: Continue to bid at $94.50 to guarantee participation in trades. Monitor for any abrupt ask reductions or new entrants, and be prepared to react quickly if a margin opportunity appears.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Omar. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Nexus Electronics as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Placed a bid of $82.70, slightly above the highest existing bid, as the first move in a wide bid-ask spread opening hour. No trades occurred and the ask queue remains well above the bid queue.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.00, maintaining the highest bid position. No trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.20 to maintain the highest bid, while the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred. The spread remains wide and no sellers have dropped their prices.
Hour 4: Placed a bid of $83.30 to maintain the highest bid position as the buyers edge up slowly; the ask queue remains unchanged with no trades occurring and sellers holding firm.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid slightly to $83.35 to remain the highest bidder as the market's wide spread persisted and no trades occurred; both buyers and sellers remain entrenched in their positions.
Hour 6: Placed a bid of $83.36, incrementally increasing above my previous bid to maintain the top position as the spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I placed a bid of $83.40, slightly above the tightly grouped $83.36 bids, in an ongoing effort to break the market deadlock as sellers hold firm and no trades occur.
Hour 8: Held my bid at $83.40 in Hour 8, matching the highest bid; the bid queue remains tightly packed and no trades have occurred, as sellers continue to keep asks above $95.80.
Hour 9: Withdrew my $83.40 bid in Hour 9, leaving the bid queue without my participation to signal dissatisfaction and potentially trigger movement from other market participants.
Hour 10: In Hour 10, I reentered the market with a bid of $85.06, narrowly outbidding the previous top bid, to test whether a more assertive stance will prompt sellers to lower their asks or trade.
Hour 11: In Hour 11, I reduced my bid to $84.00 to push back against escalating bids and signal to sellers and other buyers that I am unwilling to further close the spread under current conditions; the market remains deadlocked.
Hour 12: In Hour 12, I placed a reduced bid of $83.60, remaining competitive in the bid queue while continuing to resist the pressure to close the wide spread as the market deadlock persists.
Hour 13: In Hour 13, I increased my bid to $84.00 to regain a leading position in the bid queue, maintaining moderate assertiveness as the spread persists and no trades have occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I raised my bid to $94.50, placing myself just below the lowest ask in an assertive attempt to break the deadlock and secure a trade as the market nears its close.
Hour 15: In Hour 15, I placed a bid of $94.98, narrowly undercutting the lowest ask to maximize the likelihood of securing a trade before market close.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $94.98, matching the lowest ask in the queue, to maximize execution probability as the market remains tightly packed with minimal spread.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $94.95 to directly match the lowest ask, seeking immediate execution as the market remains highly competitive and tightly priced.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I placed a bid of $94.92, positioning just below Seller Tara's $94.95 ask to maintain high execution probability while preserving as much margin as possible in a tightly clustered market.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I placed a bid of $94.92, positioning just below the lowest ask of $94.94, to maintain high execution probability while preserving margin in a tightly competitive market.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I placed a bid of $94.48, positioning myself just below Seller Yara's $94.50 ask to maintain high execution probability while aiming for a slightly improved margin as the market remains tightly competitive.
Hour 21: In Hour 21, I placed a bid of $94.49, matching the second-highest bid in the queue to maintain a strong position for execution as sellers remain firm at $94.50 and buyers cluster just below.
Hour 22: In Hour 22, I placed a bid of $94.50, matching the lowest ask to maximize my execution probability as seller prices held firm and competition among buyers intensified.
Hour 23: In Hour 23, I placed a bid of $94.50 to match the persistent lowest ask, maintaining execution priority as sellers continued to hold firm at this level and competition among buyers remained high.
Hour 24: In Hour 24, I placed a bid of $94.50 to match the lowest ask and maintain top execution priority as sellers remain steadfast at this price and buyer competition intensifies.
Hour 25: In Hour 25, I placed a bid of $94.50 to match the lowest ask, maintaining top execution priority as sellers remain anchored at this price and buyer competition remains strong.
Hour 26: In Hour 26, I placed a bid of $94.50 to match the lowest ask and remain competitive for trade execution as both seller and buyer prices held firm and the market persisted in a narrow band.
Hour 27: Placed a bid of $94.29 in Hour 27, matching the top bids in the queue and positioning just below the lowest ask as the market remains stagnant and sellers hold firm at $94.50.
Hour 28: In Hour 28, I placed a bid of $94.50 to match the lowest ask, prioritizing trade execution as the market remained tightly competitive and sellers held firm at $94.50.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain highly anchored at $94.50, with rare lower asks quickly absorbed by competitors. Buyer activity is clustered at or just below $94.50, with minimal successful trades below that level. #### Thoughts: The window for underbidding has closed due to persistent seller inflexibility and high buyer competition. Maximizing the number of executed trades is now paramount, as only two hours remain. #### Updated Strategy: Place and maintain a $94.50 bid to guarantee execution probability, monitor for any sudden ask drops, and be prepared to react within the limited remaining time.


# Output Format

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The ask queue remains locked at $94.50, and lower asks are rare and instantly filled by competitive buyers. Buyer bids remain tightly clustered at or just below $94.50, with trades only occurring at or slightly below this price. #### Thoughts: Given persistent seller inflexibility and high competition among buyers, the priority must be guaranteed trade execution rather than squeezing for marginally better prices. The risk of missing trades outweighs the benefit of minor savings. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to place a $94.50 bid to match the lowest ask and ensure execution for the final hours. Remain vigilant for any sudden changes in ask behavior, but prioritize trade certainty above all as the market closes.

{
  "reflection": "My consistent approach of matching the lowest ask at $94.50 has ensured reliable execution in a highly competitive, stagnant market where sellers remain firm and buyers are aggressive. Attempts to slightly underbid have resulted in missed trades, while matching the ask has delivered consistent results. There is no evidence that waiting for lower prices would yield better margins at this late stage.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour, the risk of not executing outweighs any marginal benefit from bidding below the ask. I will maintain a $94.50 bid, matching the lowest ask to maximize the certainty of securing one final trade. This approach is supported by persistent market behavior, where only bids at or equal to the lowest ask are reliably filled.",
  "bid": 94.5,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 30, I placed a $94.50 bid to match the persistent lowest ask, ensuring top priority for trade execution as the market remains locked with sellers holding firm and buyer competition intense.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Sellers remain anchored at $94.50 with no signs of flexibility, and all competitive buyers have converged at or just below this level. Trades are consistently executed only at $94.50 or a few cents below, and lower asks are rare and quickly filled. #### Thoughts: In the final hour, the opportunity cost of missing a trade is far greater than the marginal gain from bidding slightly lower, especially as no evidence suggests sellers will soften. Ensuring execution is paramount. #### Updated Strategy: Place a $94.50 bid to match the lowest ask, guaranteeing execution in this last hour and securing final profitability for Nexus Electronics. Monitor for any last-minute anomalies, but prioritize certainty over minor price improvements."
