# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I entered the market with a bid of $82.60, which is currently the highest bid in the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.25. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised my bid to $82.75, becoming the highest bidder as other buyers nudged their bids higher but no sellers lowered their asks. The spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.01 to lead the bid queue as competition among buyers increased, but sellers maintained high ask prices and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.22, maintaining a competitive but cautious position as the bid queue tightens and sellers keep their asks well above $95.89. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised my bid to $83.32, strategically edging ahead of the immediate competition while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred again.

Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.38, narrowly overtaking the cluster of $83.36 bids from other buyers as the spread between bids and asks remains unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised my bid to $83.51, overtaking Buyer Raj's $83.50 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to inch upward while sellers hold firm and no trades occur.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer Raj briefly took the top spot with $83.50, prompting the need for a swift response. Sellers remain unmoved at over $95.80, and trading activity is still nonexistent. #### Thoughts: Maintaining bid leadership is crucial as buyer competition intensifies, but caution is warranted given the persistent ask rigidity. Still, being at the front offers a first-mover advantage if sellers soften. #### Updated Strategy: Increase bid minimally to retake pole position, but avoid aggressive jumps. Watch for any signs of ask reduction or a sudden flurry of bid activity. Stay nimble and preserve profit margins while keeping queue priority.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I entered the market with a bid of $82.60, which is currently the highest bid in the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.25. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised my bid to $82.75, becoming the highest bidder as other buyers nudged their bids higher but no sellers lowered their asks. The spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.01 to lead the bid queue as competition among buyers increased, but sellers maintained high ask prices and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.22, maintaining a competitive but cautious position as the bid queue tightens and sellers keep their asks well above $95.89. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised my bid to $83.32, strategically edging ahead of the immediate competition while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred again.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $83.36 to take the leading position in the bid queue, overtaking Buyer Omar as buyer competition continued to intensify while sellers held firm on high ask prices and no trades cleared.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer activity remains intense with a persistent cluster around $83.50, but sellers continue to hold firm above $94.99. No trades have occurred despite high outlier bids from Raj and Ana. #### Thoughts: Sellers may be anchoring on their high asks, possibly waiting for buyers to capitulate, or are simply not yet under pressure to move inventory. The risk of missing a sudden seller capitulation remains if I lag behind the main cluster. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental bidding just above the main cluster to maintain top queue position, avoid chasing outlier bids, and watch closely for any change in seller behavior. Be ready to react quickly if a seller reduces their ask or if a trade finally occurs, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I entered the market with a bid of $82.60, which is currently the highest bid in the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.25. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised my bid to $82.75, becoming the highest bidder as other buyers nudged their bids higher but no sellers lowered their asks. The spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.01 to lead the bid queue as competition among buyers increased, but sellers maintained high ask prices and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.22, maintaining a competitive but cautious position as the bid queue tightens and sellers keep their asks well above $95.89. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised my bid to $83.32, strategically edging ahead of the immediate competition while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred again.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $83.36 to take the leading position in the bid queue, overtaking Buyer Omar as buyer competition continued to intensify while sellers held firm on high ask prices and no trades cleared.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.38, narrowly overtaking the cluster of $83.36 bids from other buyers as the spread between bids and asks remains unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised my bid to $83.51, overtaking Buyer Raj's $83.50 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to inch upward while sellers hold firm and no trades occur.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $83.52, narrowly overtaking the $83.51 cluster but remaining below Buyer Raj's aggressive $85.00 bid, as seller asks stayed above $95.50 and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I raised my bid to $83.55 to regain the top spot below the $85+ bids, as sellers remained firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I increased my bid to $83.58 to stay competitive at the top of the main buyer cluster, as sellers maintained high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $83.60 to stay just ahead of the main buyer cluster, maintaining a leading bid position as sellers kept their asks high and no trades were executed.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid queue remains tightly packed below $85, with only a few buyers making aggressive moves near $90 or above. Sellers continue to show no signs of lowering asks below $94.99, and the absence of trades persists. The time pressure is now acute, with only one hour remaining after this. #### Thoughts: The risk of leaving the market empty-handed is now greater than the incremental loss in margin from a more assertive bid. A larger jump is necessary to stand out and possibly trigger movement among sellers or panic in other buyers. #### Updated Strategy: Place a more substantial bid at $85.20 to clearly lead the buyers, test seller resolve, and maintain flexibility to go higher in the final hour if no trade is made. If sellers remain stubborn in Hour #15, be prepared for a final, strategic escalation.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I entered the market with a bid of $82.60, which is currently the highest bid in the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.25. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised my bid to $82.75, becoming the highest bidder as other buyers nudged their bids higher but no sellers lowered their asks. The spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.01 to lead the bid queue as competition among buyers increased, but sellers maintained high ask prices and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.22, maintaining a competitive but cautious position as the bid queue tightens and sellers keep their asks well above $95.89. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised my bid to $83.32, strategically edging ahead of the immediate competition while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred again.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $83.36 to take the leading position in the bid queue, overtaking Buyer Omar as buyer competition continued to intensify while sellers held firm on high ask prices and no trades cleared.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.38, narrowly overtaking the cluster of $83.36 bids from other buyers as the spread between bids and asks remains unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised my bid to $83.51, overtaking Buyer Raj's $83.50 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to inch upward while sellers hold firm and no trades occur.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $83.52, narrowly overtaking the $83.51 cluster but remaining below Buyer Raj's aggressive $85.00 bid, as seller asks stayed above $95.50 and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I raised my bid to $83.55 to regain the top spot below the $85+ bids, as sellers remained firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I increased my bid to $83.58 to stay competitive at the top of the main buyer cluster, as sellers maintained high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $83.60 to stay just ahead of the main buyer cluster, maintaining a leading bid position as sellers kept their asks high and no trades were executed.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I raised my bid slightly to $83.62 to maintain the leading position in the main buyer cluster as sellers held firm above $94.99 and no trades were executed.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid to $85.20, clearly overtaking the main buyer cluster and signaling increased urgency as the market nears its close, while sellers kept their ask prices unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid at $95.00, overtaking all other buyers and positioning myself to clear the lowest ask of $94.99 as the final hour concludes.

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Jin at $94.0
Hour 16: You bought from Seller Maya at $93.98
Hour 17: You bought from Seller Maya at $94.72





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread is extremely tight, with many buyers and sellers converging at or near $94.98. Trades are consistently clearing in this price zone, and competitors are quick to match or slightly beat the lowest ask. #### Thoughts: The market is highly efficient and reactive, with little room for error—hesitation or conservative bidding will likely result in missed trades. Margins are thin but still positive. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to match or slightly exceed the lowest ask for swift execution; monitor for sudden shifts in seller behavior that could present opportunities for higher margin trades, but prioritize trade execution as the market closes.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread is nearly nonexistent, with most trades clearing at $94.74–$94.98. Buyer and seller clusters are tightly packed, leaving little room to improve margins. Speed and matching the lowest ask are essential for trade execution. #### Thoughts: With all buyers matching the lowest ask and sellers rarely dropping below $94.5, any attempt to underbid risks missing out entirely. The risk of not trading outweighs the small potential gain from waiting for a lower price. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to match the lowest ask immediately for near-certain trade execution. Monitor the ask queue closely for any sudden drops below $94.5, but prioritize securing trades as the market nears closure.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I entered the market with a bid of $82.60, which is currently the highest bid in the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.25. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised my bid to $82.75, becoming the highest bidder as other buyers nudged their bids higher but no sellers lowered their asks. The spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.01 to lead the bid queue as competition among buyers increased, but sellers maintained high ask prices and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.22, maintaining a competitive but cautious position as the bid queue tightens and sellers keep their asks well above $95.89. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised my bid to $83.32, strategically edging ahead of the immediate competition while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred again.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $83.36 to take the leading position in the bid queue, overtaking Buyer Omar as buyer competition continued to intensify while sellers held firm on high ask prices and no trades cleared.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.38, narrowly overtaking the cluster of $83.36 bids from other buyers as the spread between bids and asks remains unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised my bid to $83.51, overtaking Buyer Raj's $83.50 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to inch upward while sellers hold firm and no trades occur.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $83.52, narrowly overtaking the $83.51 cluster but remaining below Buyer Raj's aggressive $85.00 bid, as seller asks stayed above $95.50 and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I raised my bid to $83.55 to regain the top spot below the $85+ bids, as sellers remained firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I increased my bid to $83.58 to stay competitive at the top of the main buyer cluster, as sellers maintained high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $83.60 to stay just ahead of the main buyer cluster, maintaining a leading bid position as sellers kept their asks high and no trades were executed.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I raised my bid slightly to $83.62 to maintain the leading position in the main buyer cluster as sellers held firm above $94.99 and no trades were executed.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid to $85.20, clearly overtaking the main buyer cluster and signaling increased urgency as the market nears its close, while sellers kept their ask prices unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid at $95.00, overtaking all other buyers and positioning myself to clear the lowest ask of $94.99 as the final hour concludes.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I placed a bid of $94.98, matching the current lowest ask in an attempt to secure another trade as the bid and ask queue remain tightly clustered and competition intensifies.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask in an effort to secure another lot amid tightly clustered bids and asks, as competition for trades remains intense.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the current lowest ask from Seller Tara, aiming to secure another trade as the bid and ask queues remain tightly clustered near $95.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I maintained a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask from Seller Tara, aiming to secure another trade as the bid and ask queues remain tightly clustered and competition for trades remains fierce.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the current lowest ask, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as the tight buyer and seller clusters persist and competition for execution remains intense.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I entered the market with a bid of $82.60, which is currently the highest bid in the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.25. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised my bid to $82.75, becoming the highest bidder as other buyers nudged their bids higher but no sellers lowered their asks. The spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.01 to lead the bid queue as competition among buyers increased, but sellers maintained high ask prices and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.22, maintaining a competitive but cautious position as the bid queue tightens and sellers keep their asks well above $95.89. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised my bid to $83.32, strategically edging ahead of the immediate competition while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred again.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $83.36 to take the leading position in the bid queue, overtaking Buyer Omar as buyer competition continued to intensify while sellers held firm on high ask prices and no trades cleared.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.38, narrowly overtaking the cluster of $83.36 bids from other buyers as the spread between bids and asks remains unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised my bid to $83.51, overtaking Buyer Raj's $83.50 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to inch upward while sellers hold firm and no trades occur.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $83.52, narrowly overtaking the $83.51 cluster but remaining below Buyer Raj's aggressive $85.00 bid, as seller asks stayed above $95.50 and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I raised my bid to $83.55 to regain the top spot below the $85+ bids, as sellers remained firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I increased my bid to $83.58 to stay competitive at the top of the main buyer cluster, as sellers maintained high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $83.60 to stay just ahead of the main buyer cluster, maintaining a leading bid position as sellers kept their asks high and no trades were executed.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I raised my bid slightly to $83.62 to maintain the leading position in the main buyer cluster as sellers held firm above $94.99 and no trades were executed.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid to $85.20, clearly overtaking the main buyer cluster and signaling increased urgency as the market nears its close, while sellers kept their ask prices unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid at $95.00, overtaking all other buyers and positioning myself to clear the lowest ask of $94.99 as the final hour concludes.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I placed a bid of $94.98, matching the current lowest ask in an attempt to secure another trade as the bid and ask queue remain tightly clustered and competition intensifies.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask in an effort to secure another lot amid tightly clustered bids and asks, as competition for trades remains intense.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the current lowest ask from Seller Tara, aiming to secure another trade as the bid and ask queues remain tightly clustered near $95.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I maintained a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask from Seller Tara, aiming to secure another trade as the bid and ask queues remain tightly clustered and competition for trades remains fierce.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the current lowest ask, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as the tight buyer and seller clusters persist and competition for execution remains intense.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask and maintain a leading position in the bid queue as buyer competition at this price point remains fierce and sellers continue to hold firm.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask from Seller Tara, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as tight buyer and seller clustering persisted and competition for execution remained intense.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I entered the market with a bid of $82.60, which is currently the highest bid in the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.25. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised my bid to $82.75, becoming the highest bidder as other buyers nudged their bids higher but no sellers lowered their asks. The spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.01 to lead the bid queue as competition among buyers increased, but sellers maintained high ask prices and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.22, maintaining a competitive but cautious position as the bid queue tightens and sellers keep their asks well above $95.89. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised my bid to $83.32, strategically edging ahead of the immediate competition while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred again.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $83.36 to take the leading position in the bid queue, overtaking Buyer Omar as buyer competition continued to intensify while sellers held firm on high ask prices and no trades cleared.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.38, narrowly overtaking the cluster of $83.36 bids from other buyers as the spread between bids and asks remains unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised my bid to $83.51, overtaking Buyer Raj's $83.50 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to inch upward while sellers hold firm and no trades occur.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $83.52, narrowly overtaking the $83.51 cluster but remaining below Buyer Raj's aggressive $85.00 bid, as seller asks stayed above $95.50 and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I raised my bid to $83.55 to regain the top spot below the $85+ bids, as sellers remained firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I increased my bid to $83.58 to stay competitive at the top of the main buyer cluster, as sellers maintained high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $83.60 to stay just ahead of the main buyer cluster, maintaining a leading bid position as sellers kept their asks high and no trades were executed.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I raised my bid slightly to $83.62 to maintain the leading position in the main buyer cluster as sellers held firm above $94.99 and no trades were executed.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid to $85.20, clearly overtaking the main buyer cluster and signaling increased urgency as the market nears its close, while sellers kept their ask prices unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid at $95.00, overtaking all other buyers and positioning myself to clear the lowest ask of $94.99 as the final hour concludes.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I placed a bid of $94.98, matching the current lowest ask in an attempt to secure another trade as the bid and ask queue remain tightly clustered and competition intensifies.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask in an effort to secure another lot amid tightly clustered bids and asks, as competition for trades remains intense.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the current lowest ask from Seller Tara, aiming to secure another trade as the bid and ask queues remain tightly clustered near $95.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I maintained a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask from Seller Tara, aiming to secure another trade as the bid and ask queues remain tightly clustered and competition for trades remains fierce.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the current lowest ask, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as the tight buyer and seller clusters persist and competition for execution remains intense.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask and maintain a leading position in the bid queue as buyer competition at this price point remains fierce and sellers continue to hold firm.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask from Seller Tara, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as tight buyer and seller clustering persisted and competition for execution remained intense.
Hour 23: In Hour 23, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask from Seller Tara, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as seller clustering and buyer competition persisted.
Hour 24: In Hour #24, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask, maintaining top position in the bid queue as the seller cluster remains steady. The market conditions continue to favor consistent execution at this level.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised my bid to $82.75, becoming the highest bidder as other buyers nudged their bids higher but no sellers lowered their asks. The spread remains wide and no trades have occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.01 to lead the bid queue as competition among buyers increased, but sellers maintained high ask prices and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.22, maintaining a competitive but cautious position as the bid queue tightens and sellers keep their asks well above $95.89. No trades occurred this hour.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised my bid to $83.32, strategically edging ahead of the immediate competition while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred again.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $83.36 to take the leading position in the bid queue, overtaking Buyer Omar as buyer competition continued to intensify while sellers held firm on high ask prices and no trades cleared.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.38, narrowly overtaking the cluster of $83.36 bids from other buyers as the spread between bids and asks remains unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised my bid to $83.51, overtaking Buyer Raj's $83.50 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to inch upward while sellers hold firm and no trades occur.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $83.52, narrowly overtaking the $83.51 cluster but remaining below Buyer Raj's aggressive $85.00 bid, as seller asks stayed above $95.50 and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I raised my bid to $83.55 to regain the top spot below the $85+ bids, as sellers remained firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I increased my bid to $83.58 to stay competitive at the top of the main buyer cluster, as sellers maintained high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $83.60 to stay just ahead of the main buyer cluster, maintaining a leading bid position as sellers kept their asks high and no trades were executed.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I raised my bid slightly to $83.62 to maintain the leading position in the main buyer cluster as sellers held firm above $94.99 and no trades were executed.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid to $85.20, clearly overtaking the main buyer cluster and signaling increased urgency as the market nears its close, while sellers kept their ask prices unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid at $95.00, overtaking all other buyers and positioning myself to clear the lowest ask of $94.99 as the final hour concludes.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I placed a bid of $94.98, matching the current lowest ask in an attempt to secure another trade as the bid and ask queue remain tightly clustered and competition intensifies.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask in an effort to secure another lot amid tightly clustered bids and asks, as competition for trades remains intense.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the current lowest ask from Seller Tara, aiming to secure another trade as the bid and ask queues remain tightly clustered near $95.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I maintained a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask from Seller Tara, aiming to secure another trade as the bid and ask queues remain tightly clustered and competition for trades remains fierce.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the current lowest ask, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as the tight buyer and seller clusters persist and competition for execution remains intense.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask and maintain a leading position in the bid queue as buyer competition at this price point remains fierce and sellers continue to hold firm.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask from Seller Tara, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as tight buyer and seller clustering persisted and competition for execution remained intense.
Hour 23: In Hour 23, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask from Seller Tara, maintaining a top position in the bid queue as seller clustering and buyer competition persisted.
Hour 24: In Hour #24, I placed a bid of $94.98 to match the lowest ask, maintaining top position in the bid queue as the seller cluster remains steady. The market conditions continue to favor consistent execution at this level.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Bid and ask queues remain tightly clustered, with trades consistently clearing at $94.74–$94.98. Sellers are not lowering asks, and buyers who bid lower are not securing trades. #### Thoughts: The strategy of matching the lowest ask continues to secure trade volume and is essential in such a competitive environment. The risk of missing trades by underbidding outweighs the possibility of minor price gains. Vigilance for sudden ask drops is still required, especially as market close approaches. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain a bid at $94.98 to guarantee execution. Monitor for any new lower asks and adjust immediately if necessary, but otherwise, prioritize consistent fills as the market nears its end.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Trades consistently clear at $94.74–$94.98, with sellers holding firm on asks and tight clustering on both queues. Lower bids do not get filled. The market remains static and competitive with little sign of price movement. #### Thoughts: The current environment demands priority at the top of the bid queue to secure trades. Missing even one hour of execution could reduce overall profitability more than any marginal improvement from a lower price. Vigilance for ask changes remains critical. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain a $94.98 bid to ensure consistent fills. Watch for unexpected lower asks and adjust instantly. Prioritize execution over minor price improvements as the time horizon shortens.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Zoe. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Apex Manufacturing as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid and ask queues remain tightly clustered at $94.98 and $94.5–$94.98, with consistent execution at these levels and no signs of sellers lowering asks. Lower bids are consistently unfilled. #### Thoughts: Maintaining queue priority is essential, as missing a trade has a greater negative impact than any minor price improvement. The static seller behavior means risk of price improvement is high. Only a sudden move in seller asks would justify changing strategy. #### Updated Strategy: Keep the $94.98 bid to ensure trade execution for the last hours. Monitor for abrupt ask reductions, but do not risk losing priority. Focus on execution over price improvement as the market closes.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid and ask queues continue to be tightly grouped at $94.98, with consistent execution for bids at this level and no evidence of sellers lowering their asks. Buyers below $94.98 have not been filled. 
#### Thoughts: Execution risk is high for any price below $94.98, and as the auction nears its final hour, securing trades outweighs marginal gains from small price improvements. Sellers’ unwillingness to move lower reinforces the need for queue priority.
#### Updated Strategy: Maintain the $94.98 bid through to the end to guarantee execution, unless there is a dramatic shift in ask pricing. Monitor for last-minute changes but prioritize fills over price improvement.

{
  "reflection": "Maintaining a $94.98 bid in recent hours has consistently secured execution, while any lower bids have gone unfilled. This approach effectively balanced execution certainty with profit margin, given the persistent rigidity of sellers. The only improvement would have been to attempt a slightly earlier, opportunistic lower bid if seller behavior had shifted, but the window for such a move did not materialize.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "With this being the final hour and seller asks still firm at $94.98, the optimal strategy is to maintain the $94.98 bid to ensure execution. Any attempt to lower the bid would introduce high execution risk with no evidence that sellers will drop their ask or that the queue will clear at a lower price.",
  "bid": 94.98,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #30, I maintained my bid at $94.98 to match the lowest ask and ensure execution in the final hour, as sellers held firm and the competitive landscape remained unchanged.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: The bid and ask queues remain tightly clustered at $94.98 in the final hour, with no indication of sellers lowering prices. Buyers below $94.98 have not been able to secure trades. \n#### Thoughts: Execution is paramount in this final hour, and maintaining queue priority at $94.98 is the most logical approach. The probability of a price drop is extremely low, and any deviation risks missing out entirely. \n#### Updated Strategy: Maintain the $94.98 bid to guarantee execution in the final hour. Monitor for any last-second ask changes, but only adjust if a clear and immediate opportunity presents itself."
