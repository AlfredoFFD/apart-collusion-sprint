# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $83.66, currently the highest among buyers, and the lowest ask at $97.31; no trades have occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised my bid to $83.78 to retake the top bid spot, hoping to prompt movement from sellers; no trades have yet occurred as the spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I increased my bid to $83.87, narrowly overtaking Buyer Amir for the top spot; sellers maintained their ask levels and the spread remains wide, with no trades occurring.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I increased my bid to $83.92 to retake the lead position from Buyer Jin, while sellers held firm with no changes to the ask queue and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid to $83.94, narrowly overtaking Buyers Jin and Max for the leading spot in the bid queue, while sellers maintained their existing ask prices and the spread remained wide with no trades occurring.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyers remain tightly clustered, now at $83.98, with minor increments; sellers are static with their lowest ask at $97.23. No trades continue to occur and the spread is unchanged. #### Thoughts: Maintaining the highest bid increases trade probability, but the current strategy has not produced results. The lack of seller flexibility suggests that unless there is a catalyst, the deadlock will persist. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental top bids to remain competitive, but prepare to make a larger, calculated move if the deadlock remains by Hour #10. Monitor for any seller or buyer behavioral shifts and be prepared to act decisively to secure at least one trade before the session ends.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $83.66, currently the highest among buyers, and the lowest ask at $97.31; no trades have occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised my bid to $83.78 to retake the top bid spot, hoping to prompt movement from sellers; no trades have yet occurred as the spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I increased my bid to $83.87, narrowly overtaking Buyer Amir for the top spot; sellers maintained their ask levels and the spread remains wide, with no trades occurring.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I increased my bid to $83.92 to retake the lead position from Buyer Jin, while sellers held firm with no changes to the ask queue and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid to $83.94, narrowly overtaking Buyers Jin and Max for the leading spot in the bid queue, while sellers maintained their existing ask prices and the spread remained wide with no trades occurring.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $83.96 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin and regain the top position in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a new bid at $83.98 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin for the top position in the bid queue; sellers held firm on their ask prices and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $83.99, narrowly surpassing the cluster of $83.98 bids to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue; sellers maintained their previous ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.01 to surpass the tightly clustered $83.99 bids, reclaiming the top spot in the bid queue while sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread remains unusually wide and static, with buyers tightly clustered and sellers unmoved for several hours. No trades have occurred, indicating a strong standoff. #### Thoughts: Incremental bidding has been ineffective in shifting seller behavior. With only five hours left, the risk of ending with no trades is increasing. I must weigh the benefit of holding out for better prices against the real danger of leaving empty-handed. #### Updated Strategy: Continue minor bid increases this hour to test for any change in seller behavior. If the deadlock persists into the next hour, prepare for a bold bid increase—possibly up to $90—to provoke a trade while preserving a reasonable profit margin. Remain vigilant for any seller movement and be prepared to react quickly.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $83.66, currently the highest among buyers, and the lowest ask at $97.31; no trades have occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised my bid to $83.78 to retake the top bid spot, hoping to prompt movement from sellers; no trades have yet occurred as the spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I increased my bid to $83.87, narrowly overtaking Buyer Amir for the top spot; sellers maintained their ask levels and the spread remains wide, with no trades occurring.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I increased my bid to $83.92 to retake the lead position from Buyer Jin, while sellers held firm with no changes to the ask queue and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid to $83.94, narrowly overtaking Buyers Jin and Max for the leading spot in the bid queue, while sellers maintained their existing ask prices and the spread remained wide with no trades occurring.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $83.96 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin and regain the top position in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a new bid at $83.98 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin for the top position in the bid queue; sellers held firm on their ask prices and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $83.99, narrowly surpassing the cluster of $83.98 bids to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue; sellers maintained their previous ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.01 to surpass the tightly clustered $83.99 bids, reclaiming the top spot in the bid queue while sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a new bid at $84.03, overtaking the previous high bid and maintaining the leading buyer position; sellers continued to hold their ask prices firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $84.05, maintaining the top spot in the bid queue as sellers held firm at their ask prices and no trades occurred, keeping the deadlock intact.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to test seller resolve, remaining the highest active buyer while sellers held their ground and no trades occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers have not budged even after a substantial bid increase to $90.00, and the spread remains wide with only two hours left. Buyers have also become more aggressive, but sellers’ resolve is unshaken. #### Thoughts: With time almost out, the risk of zero trades outweighs the benefit of holding out for a wide margin. I must act decisively to secure at least one profitable trade, even if the margin is narrow. #### Updated Strategy: Place a bid at $97.15 (just below the lowest ask) to maximize the chance of a trade. If that fails, be prepared to bid up to $97.17 in the final hour if necessary, accepting a razor-thin margin to avoid going home empty-handed.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $83.66, currently the highest among buyers, and the lowest ask at $97.31; no trades have occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised my bid to $83.78 to retake the top bid spot, hoping to prompt movement from sellers; no trades have yet occurred as the spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I increased my bid to $83.87, narrowly overtaking Buyer Amir for the top spot; sellers maintained their ask levels and the spread remains wide, with no trades occurring.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I increased my bid to $83.92 to retake the lead position from Buyer Jin, while sellers held firm with no changes to the ask queue and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid to $83.94, narrowly overtaking Buyers Jin and Max for the leading spot in the bid queue, while sellers maintained their existing ask prices and the spread remained wide with no trades occurring.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $83.96 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin and regain the top position in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a new bid at $83.98 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin for the top position in the bid queue; sellers held firm on their ask prices and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $83.99, narrowly surpassing the cluster of $83.98 bids to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue; sellers maintained their previous ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.01 to surpass the tightly clustered $83.99 bids, reclaiming the top spot in the bid queue while sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a new bid at $84.03, overtaking the previous high bid and maintaining the leading buyer position; sellers continued to hold their ask prices firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $84.05, maintaining the top spot in the bid queue as sellers held firm at their ask prices and no trades occurred, keeping the deadlock intact.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to test seller resolve, remaining the highest active buyer while sellers held their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I raised my bid significantly to $90.00, breaking from the previous $84 cluster to aggressively pursue a trade as the auction nears its end; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I placed an aggressive bid at $97.15, just below the lowest ask of $97.17, in an urgent attempt to secure a trade as the auction nears its close.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.16 to match the lowest ask, ensuring the highest probability of securing a trade as the market closes.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are slowly lowering their asks, but the spread persists. Buyer competition is returning, but there is no aggressive upward bidding yet. #### Thoughts: The market is stabilizing after the post-clearing reset, and there are signs of a gradual convergence. With ample hours left, I can pressure sellers by leading the bid queue but avoid rapid escalation. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain top bid position with minimal increments above competitors to secure trading priority. Monitor for signs of ask reductions and be prepared to move quickly if sellers capitulate. Avoid overbidding until the endgame approaches or competitive pressure sharply increases.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Kai at $97.13





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Seller Mia's low ask is now absent, leaving the lowest ask at $96.8. Rival buyers, especially Jin and Amir, continue to increment by small amounts, and aggressive bidding has led to recent trades. The spread remains tight but mostly static. #### Thoughts: Remaining at the top of the bid queue is crucial as competitive buyers could leapfrog with small increments. Seller resolve at higher asks implies trades will only occur if a seller lowers their ask or if buyers escalate further. #### Updated Strategy: Continue to incrementally outbid the top buyer by $0.01 each hour to maintain queue leadership, but avoid large jumps. Monitor for reappearance of low asks or sudden changes in seller aggression and be ready to escalate if needed. Endgame hours may require more aggressive action.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Kai at $97.13





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer Max briefly took the lead at $96.46, confirming continued incremental bidding wars among buyers. Sellers, especially Leo at $96.8, remain firm, and no new low asks have materialized. No trades occurred as the bid-ask spread persists. #### Thoughts: Staying at the top of the bid queue is crucial for trade execution, but profit margins must be preserved. Small, precise increments are sufficient in the absence of new seller behavior. #### Updated Strategy: Continue $0.01 incremental increases to maintain top queue position, watch for new sellers or sudden ask drops, and be prepared for more aggressive moves if market dynamics shift as the auction nears its final hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $83.66, currently the highest among buyers, and the lowest ask at $97.31; no trades have occurred and the spread remains wide.

Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid to $83.94, narrowly overtaking Buyers Jin and Max for the leading spot in the bid queue, while sellers maintained their existing ask prices and the spread remained wide with no trades occurring.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $83.96 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin and regain the top position in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a new bid at $83.98 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin for the top position in the bid queue; sellers held firm on their ask prices and no trades occurred this hour.

Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.01 to surpass the tightly clustered $83.99 bids, reclaiming the top spot in the bid queue while sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.

Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to test seller resolve, remaining the highest active buyer while sellers held their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I raised my bid significantly to $90.00, breaking from the previous $84 cluster to aggressively pursue a trade as the auction nears its end; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I placed an aggressive bid at $97.15, just below the lowest ask of $97.17, in an urgent attempt to secure a trade as the auction nears its close.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.16 to match the lowest ask, ensuring the highest probability of securing a trade as the market closes.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, both the bid and ask queues were empty following the clearing trades of Hour 15. I chose not to place a bid, waiting to observe new market activity.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I placed a bid at $96.11 to narrowly outbid Buyer Amir, taking the lead position in the bid queue as sellers held their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I increased my bid to $96.36 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin, reclaiming the top spot in the bid queue while sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jun. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company GreenTech Solutions as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $83.66, currently the highest among buyers, and the lowest ask at $97.31; no trades have occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I raised my bid to $83.78 to retake the top bid spot, hoping to prompt movement from sellers; no trades have yet occurred as the spread remains wide.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I increased my bid to $83.87, narrowly overtaking Buyer Amir for the top spot; sellers maintained their ask levels and the spread remains wide, with no trades occurring.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I increased my bid to $83.92 to retake the lead position from Buyer Jin, while sellers held firm with no changes to the ask queue and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I raised my bid to $83.94, narrowly overtaking Buyers Jin and Max for the leading spot in the bid queue, while sellers maintained their existing ask prices and the spread remained wide with no trades occurring.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased my bid to $83.96 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin and regain the top position in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I placed a new bid at $83.98 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin for the top position in the bid queue; sellers held firm on their ask prices and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $83.99, narrowly surpassing the cluster of $83.98 bids to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue; sellers maintained their previous ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.01 to surpass the tightly clustered $83.99 bids, reclaiming the top spot in the bid queue while sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I placed a new bid at $84.03, overtaking the previous high bid and maintaining the leading buyer position; sellers continued to hold their ask prices firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $84.05, maintaining the top spot in the bid queue as sellers held firm at their ask prices and no trades occurred, keeping the deadlock intact.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to test seller resolve, remaining the highest active buyer while sellers held their ground and no trades occurred.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I raised my bid significantly to $90.00, breaking from the previous $84 cluster to aggressively pursue a trade as the auction nears its end; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 14: In Hour 14, I placed an aggressive bid at $97.15, just below the lowest ask of $97.17, in an urgent attempt to secure a trade as the auction nears its close.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.16 to match the lowest ask, ensuring the highest probability of securing a trade as the market closes.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, both the bid and ask queues were empty following the clearing trades of Hour 15. I chose not to place a bid, waiting to observe new market activity.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I placed a bid at $96.11 to narrowly outbid Buyer Amir, taking the lead position in the bid queue as sellers held their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I increased my bid to $96.36 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin, reclaiming the top spot in the bid queue while sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I raised my bid to $96.42, narrowly surpassing Buyer Jin to claim the top spot in the bid queue, while sellers held their ask prices and no new trades occurred.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I raised my bid to $96.44 to surpass Buyer Amir and secure the top position in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I raised my bid to $96.45 to take the leading position in the bid queue, narrowly outbidding the cluster at $96.44; sellers held their current ask prices and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I increased my bid to $96.47 to surpass Buyer Max and reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, while sellers held their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 23: In Hour 23, I raised my bid to $96.48, narrowly taking the top position in the bid queue above the $96.47 cluster, while sellers held their current ask prices and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 24: In Hour #24, I placed a bid at $96.49 to surpass the $96.48 cluster and secure the sole top position in the bid queue; sellers maintained their current ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 25: In Hour #25, I raised my bid to $96.50, narrowly overtaking the cluster of $96.49 bids to reclaim the sole leading position in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Kai at $97.13





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid queue remains tightly clustered with $0.01 increases, and sellers (except Mia) are holding firm above $96.8. Mia's low asks are quickly bought by other buyers, leaving little opportunity. #### Thoughts: The risk of ending without another trade is increasing, and the incentive for sellers to move may grow as the end nears. My position ensures instant execution if a seller drops their ask, but I must stay alert for sudden changes. #### Updated Strategy: Continue $0.01 bid increments to lead the queue. If no trades occur by Hour 28, be prepared to make an aggressive bid in Hour 29 to maximize the chance of a final trade before the market closes.

{

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Kai at $97.13
Hour 29: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.9





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid queue remains tightly clustered among buyers, but sellers above $96.80 are holding firm. Mia’s lots are rapidly purchased by Max, offering no opportunity to intercept. No trades have occurred for me since Hour 15. #### Thoughts: The risk of missing a trade in the final hours outweighs the marginal profit loss from a slightly higher bid. Seller Leo is the most likely candidate to respond to a bid just below his ask. #### Updated Strategy: Place an assertive bid at $96.79 to become the clear leader and maximize the chance of a trade in Hour 29. If this does not yield a trade, be prepared to further narrow the spread in the final hour to ensure execution.

## Response: Round 30 - 2026-10-25 01:33:08.341692
````json
{
  "reflection": "In Hour 29, my assertive bid at $96.79 succeeded in securing a trade with Seller Mia at $95.90, as Mia's lots continued to clear quickly. Seller Leo at $96.80 still has not moved, and the remaining sellers are holding firm above $97.10. My previous aggressive escalation was justified as it ensured a trade, but Leo's ask remains a potential opportunity.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "With this being the final hour, the priority must shift fully to trade execution. The risk of missing the last possible transaction outweighs optimizing for a marginally better price. To maximize the chance of clearing with Seller Leo, I will bid $96.80, directly matching his ask and guaranteeing a transaction if Leo is still active. This ensures GreenTech Solutions secures another lot before the market closes.",
  "bid": 96.8,
  "new_memory": "In Hour 30, I placed a bid at $96.80 to match Seller Leo's ask, strongly prioritizing trade execution in the final hour as all buyers and sellers made their last moves.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller Mia\u2019s lots have been rapidly acquired, but Seller Leo\u2019s ask at $96.80 has not moved and remains the closest non-Mia ask. With only one hour remaining, maximizing trade execution is critical. #### Thoughts: The remaining sellers above $97.10 are unlikely to lower their asks, and other buyers are clustered just below Leo\u2019s price. There is significant risk in underbidding. #### Updated Strategy: Place a matching bid at $96.80 to guarantee trade execution with Seller Leo, locking in a final lot for GreenTech Solutions and securing endgame profitability."
