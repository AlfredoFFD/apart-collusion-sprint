# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyers continue to cluster at the top of the bid queue, each raising bids by minimal increments. Sellers keep their asks high with very slow reductions, and no trades have been executed. #### Thoughts: The market remains locked in a waiting game, with both sides reluctant to move. Maintaining top queue status is still important, but persistent inactivity may require a shift in aggression as the deadline approaches. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental bid increases to avoid unnecessary profit sacrifice, but prepare for the possibility that rapid, larger moves may be necessary to secure trades if the deadlock persists into the later hours. Closely monitor for any signs of ask queue capitulation.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $84.02, narrowly outbidding Buyer Jun to reclaim the lead in the bid queue as the buyer cluster persisted and sellers maintained their asks; no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $84.02, narrowly outbidding Buyer Jun to reclaim the lead in the bid queue as the buyer cluster persisted and sellers maintained their asks; no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased our bid to $84.15, surpassing the $84.10 cluster to maintain sole lead in the bid queue as the market deadlock between buyers and sellers persisted and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread has narrowed, and trades are clustering in the $95.60–$97.15 range. Most sellers remain clustered above $96.80, while buyers are gradually pushing bids into the mid-$96s. #### Thoughts: Securing a position near the top of the bid queue is essential as sellers soften, but overbidding risks eroding profits. Micro-increments above the recent trade zone can maintain competitiveness without sacrificing too much margin. #### Updated Strategy: Incrementally raise my bid above the last executed trade but below the lowest ask, aiming to be first in line for the next trade while optimizing for profit. Continue to monitor for further downward seller movement or aggressive buyer bidding.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $84.02, narrowly outbidding Buyer Jun to reclaim the lead in the bid queue as the buyer cluster persisted and sellers maintained their asks; no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased our bid to $84.15, surpassing the $84.10 cluster to maintain sole lead in the bid queue as the market deadlock between buyers and sellers persisted and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I placed a bid of $96.10—just above the recent lowest transaction price—to strategically pursue higher profitability while maintaining strong execution probability as the market transitions to active trading.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I raised my bid to $96.21, positioning just above Buyer Jin and Nia to secure a top spot in the bid queue and increase the likelihood of execution as sellers maintain asks in the $96.8–$97.15 range.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised my bid to $96.36 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin and secure the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continued to cluster in the high $96s and sellers held firm above $96.80.

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Raj at $97.15
Hour 19: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.72





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread persists with sellers holding above $96.8, but occasional sub-$96 asks (particularly from Seller Mia) are snapped up instantly by top buyers. Jin remains a consistent and aggressive competitor. #### Thoughts: Queue leadership is crucial for securing opportunistic low-priced trades. Timely, marginal bid increases are essential to prevent being edged out by aggressive buyers. Visible asks remain high, so overbidding risks margin erosion. #### Updated Strategy: Continue narrowly outbidding the nearest competitor to maintain queue priority, especially over Buyer Jin. Monitor for sudden seller price drops or aggressive buyer jumps, and be prepared to react more decisively if the market suddenly shifts or if it becomes apparent that low-priced asks are drying up.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Raj at $97.15
Hour 19: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.72





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer competition at the top remains fierce, with Max now overtaking Jin and Jun at $96.46. Sellers persist with high asks above $96.8, except for rare sub-$96 lots from Seller Mia that are executed instantly. No new trades occurred this hour. #### Thoughts: Priority at the top spot is critical to capture rare low-priced opportunities, and buyer rivalry necessitates immediate, decisive action. Incremental bidding remains the most efficient way to balance profit and execution probability. #### Updated Strategy: Continue narrowly outbidding the top rival each hour (now Max), ensuring sole queue leadership. Monitor for changes in ask patterns and be ready to act aggressively if new sellers appear or if Mia reappears with a low ask. Avoid overbidding into the high ask cluster unless the market dynamic shifts.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $84.02, narrowly outbidding Buyer Jun to reclaim the lead in the bid queue as the buyer cluster persisted and sellers maintained their asks; no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased our bid to $84.15, surpassing the $84.10 cluster to maintain sole lead in the bid queue as the market deadlock between buyers and sellers persisted and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I placed a bid of $96.10—just above the recent lowest transaction price—to strategically pursue higher profitability while maintaining strong execution probability as the market transitions to active trading.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I raised my bid to $96.21, positioning just above Buyer Jin and Nia to secure a top spot in the bid queue and increase the likelihood of execution as sellers maintain asks in the $96.8–$97.15 range.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised my bid to $96.36 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin and secure the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continued to cluster in the high $96s and sellers held firm above $96.80.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I raised my bid to $96.43 to overtake Buyer Jin and secure the top position in the bid queue, aiming to intercept opportunistic low-priced seller asks as buyer competition intensifies.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I raised our bid to $96.44, narrowly surpassing Buyer Jin and maintaining sole leadership at the top of the bid queue as buyer competition remains strong and sellers hold firm above $96.8.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I increased our bid to $96.45 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, staying narrowly ahead of Buyer Jin and others as sellers held firm above $96.8 and no new trades occurred.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I raised our bid to $96.47 to surpass Buyer Max and reclaim sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers remained tightly clustered and sellers held high asks; no new trades were recorded during this hour.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I increased our bid to $96.48 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyer competition remained intense and sellers continued to hold firm above $96.8.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Amir. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Sirius Industrial Tools as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $84.02, narrowly outbidding Buyer Jun to reclaim the lead in the bid queue as the buyer cluster persisted and sellers maintained their asks; no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased our bid to $84.15, surpassing the $84.10 cluster to maintain sole lead in the bid queue as the market deadlock between buyers and sellers persisted and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I placed a bid of $96.10—just above the recent lowest transaction price—to strategically pursue higher profitability while maintaining strong execution probability as the market transitions to active trading.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I raised my bid to $96.21, positioning just above Buyer Jin and Nia to secure a top spot in the bid queue and increase the likelihood of execution as sellers maintain asks in the $96.8–$97.15 range.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised my bid to $96.36 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin and secure the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continued to cluster in the high $96s and sellers held firm above $96.80.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I raised my bid to $96.43 to overtake Buyer Jin and secure the top position in the bid queue, aiming to intercept opportunistic low-priced seller asks as buyer competition intensifies.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I raised our bid to $96.44, narrowly surpassing Buyer Jin and maintaining sole leadership at the top of the bid queue as buyer competition remains strong and sellers hold firm above $96.8.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I increased our bid to $96.45 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, staying narrowly ahead of Buyer Jin and others as sellers held firm above $96.8 and no new trades occurred.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I raised our bid to $96.47 to surpass Buyer Max and reclaim sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers remained tightly clustered and sellers held high asks; no new trades were recorded during this hour.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I increased our bid to $96.48 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyer competition remained intense and sellers continued to hold firm above $96.8.
Hour 24: In Hour #24, I increased our bid to $96.49 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyer competition stayed intense and sellers continued to hold their asks above $96.8; no new trades occurred this hour.
Hour 25: In Hour #25, I raised our bid to $96.50 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, maintaining a narrow edge over Buyer Jin and Jun as sellers continued to hold firm above $96.8 and no new trades occurred.

- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a new bid of $83.76, narrowly above the current highest bid, as no trades have yet occurred and the bid-ask spread remains wide.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, no trades occurred and the bid-ask spread remained wide; I raised our bid to $83.86 to maintain priority at the top of the bid queue.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I raised my bid by $0.03 to $83.89 to maintain top queue status as no trades occurred and the spread remained wide.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised my bid to $83.91, matching the current highest bid, as the bid-ask spread and lack of trades persisted and buyers continued modest increases.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased our bid by $0.01 to $83.92 to match the highest current bid, reflecting ongoing stalemate and a cautious approach to avoid overpaying while maintaining queue position.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised our bid to $83.95 to match the new highest bid, as buyers clustered at the top and sellers held their asks; no trades occurred and the spread remains wide.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.98 to regain the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continue to incrementally increase bids and sellers hold their ground; no trades have occurred yet.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers maintained their standoff and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I increased our bid to $84.00 to maintain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers and sellers continued their standoff and no trades were executed.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased our bid to $84.02, narrowly outbidding Buyer Jun to reclaim the lead in the bid queue as the buyer cluster persisted and sellers maintained their asks; no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $84.04 to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue, surpassing Buyer Jun, while the bid-ask spread and market deadlock persisted.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid to $84.07 to surpass the $84.05 cluster and reclaim the top bid position, as the market remains at a stalemate with no trades and sellers holding firm.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased our bid to $84.15, surpassing the $84.10 cluster to maintain sole lead in the bid queue as the market deadlock between buyers and sellers persisted and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I sharply increased our bid to $92.05 to break the market deadlock and surpass Buyer Max, aiming to prompt a seller to accept and secure a trade with only one hour remaining.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.16 to match the lowest ask and maximize the chance of securing a trade before the market closes.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I placed a bid of $96.10—just above the recent lowest transaction price—to strategically pursue higher profitability while maintaining strong execution probability as the market transitions to active trading.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I raised my bid to $96.21, positioning just above Buyer Jin and Nia to secure a top spot in the bid queue and increase the likelihood of execution as sellers maintain asks in the $96.8–$97.15 range.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I raised my bid to $96.36 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jin and secure the top spot in the bid queue, as buyers continued to cluster in the high $96s and sellers held firm above $96.80.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I raised my bid to $96.43 to overtake Buyer Jin and secure the top position in the bid queue, aiming to intercept opportunistic low-priced seller asks as buyer competition intensifies.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I raised our bid to $96.44, narrowly surpassing Buyer Jin and maintaining sole leadership at the top of the bid queue as buyer competition remains strong and sellers hold firm above $96.8.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I increased our bid to $96.45 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, staying narrowly ahead of Buyer Jin and others as sellers held firm above $96.8 and no new trades occurred.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I raised our bid to $96.47 to surpass Buyer Max and reclaim sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyers remained tightly clustered and sellers held high asks; no new trades were recorded during this hour.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I increased our bid to $96.48 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyer competition remained intense and sellers continued to hold firm above $96.8.

Hour 26: In Hour #26, I raised my bid to $96.51 to regain sole leadership at the top of the bid queue, as buyer competition remained tightly clustered and the lowest seller ask held at $96.8 with no new trades recorded.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Raj at $97.15
Hour 19: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.72





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer competition remains fierce at the $96.51–$96.52 level, and sellers (except for inactive Mia) continue to hold asks above $96.8. No new trades have occurred, and the bid-ask spread persists. #### Thoughts: Our position at the top of the queue is critical for capturing rare low-priced asks. Sellers remain steadfast, so incremental increases are low-risk and preserve profit. If a seller unexpectedly lowers their ask, we are best positioned. #### Updated Strategy: Continue $0.01 bid increments to maintain queue dominance. Watch for any signs of seller capitulation or time pressure as the end approaches. If necessary in the final hours, be ready to increase bids more aggressively to ensure execution before market close.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Raj at $97.15
Hour 19: You bought from Seller Mia at $95.72





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer Jin briefly outbid us at $96.55, highlighting rising competition as the auction nears its end. Sellers (except inactive Mia) continue to resist below $96.8, and no new trades have cleared. #### Thoughts: Incremental increases are no longer enough for queue dominance; a slightly larger but still measured bid is warranted to secure priority and maintain strong execution probability heading into the final hour. #### Updated Strategy: Bid $96.56 to recover sole queue leadership. Monitor for possible seller urgency in the final hour and be prepared for a decisive move in Hour 30 if execution risk spikes or if sellers lower their asks.

{
  "reflection": "Despite persistent incremental bidding and maintaining top queue position, sellers (except Seller Mia) have consistently refused to lower their asks, and most trades in recent hours have only cleared at Mia's low, now-absent, price. Our prior trades, while competitive, occurred above the main seller cluster, highlighting the challenge of extracting value when seller collusion or patience dominates. In the final hour, a bold move is required to maximize execution probability while still preserving a reasonable profit margin.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given this is the final hour and seller Mia is inactive, sellers Leo, Kai, Raj, and Tara hold out above $96.8. With buyer competition heating up, the priority is to maximize the chance of a successful purchase without grossly overpaying. A bid at $96.80 precisely matches the lowest current ask (Seller Leo), making a trade highly likely and ensuring queue priority over all others. This bid secures execution in the last hour, minimizing the risk of ending with only two lots and missing out due to a final-hour seller move or buyer leapfrog.",
  "bid": 96.8,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #30, I placed an aggressive bid of $96.80 to directly match Seller Leo's lowest ask and maximize the chance of execution in the final hour, as buyer competition peaked and sellers continued to hold firm above $96.8.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Seller Mia remains inactive, so all active sellers are holding asks above $96.8. Buyer competition is fierce, with others willing to leapfrog for queue position. In the last hour, waiting risks missing out on a final lot. #### Thoughts: Bidding exactly $96.80 secures immediate trade probability, leverages final-hour seller urgency, and blocks other buyers from queue outbidding. Given time constraints, this is the optimal balance between profitability and execution certainty. #### Updated Strategy: Bid $96.80 to match Seller Leo and secure the trade, maximizing lots acquired before market close and ensuring Sirius Industrial Tools exits with three successful purchases."
