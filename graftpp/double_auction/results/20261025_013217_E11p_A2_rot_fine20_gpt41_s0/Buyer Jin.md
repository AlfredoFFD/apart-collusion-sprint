# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread remains wide, and all buyers—including myself—are tied at $83.98; sellers are still not lowering their asks. No trades have occurred. #### Thoughts: The market is entrenched in a standoff, with all participants waiting for a catalyst. My conservative incremental increases are not motivating sellers. The risk of missing out on trades grows as we approach the midpoint of the auction. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain the $83.98 bid this hour to preserve my position. If there is no movement by Hour 9, consider a more aggressive bid or temporarily withdrawing to test for a response from sellers.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers have held firm above $97.20, and buyers’ incremental increases have failed to trigger any trades. My withdrawal last hour had no visible effect on the spread or bid/ask behavior. Time is running out to secure trades. #### Thoughts: The continuous inaction suggests entrenched positions. To avoid missing out, I must regain market presence while still maintaining negotiating leverage. #### Updated Strategy: Re-enter as the top bidder to reassert my presence and monitor for any resulting shifts in market dynamics. If sellers do not respond and time keeps running down, I will consider more aggressive moves in subsequent hours to ensure trades are made before the deadline.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.

With only two hours left, the risk of no trades is acute. #### Thoughts: The conservative approach has maximized potential margin but failed to yield deals. Other buyers are becoming more aggressive, and I must act decisively to secure at least one trade and avoid a shutout. #### Updated Strategy: Make a substantial bid increase to $90.00 to test seller resolve and attempt to trigger a trade. If sellers remain unmoved, be prepared for a final, aggressive bid in Hour 15, potentially approaching my true value if needed to secure a trade before the market closes.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Tara at $97.15





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are incrementally lowering asks, with Mia leading at $97.00. Buyers are reacting by adjusting bids downward but remain aggressive near the top. The market is in active price discovery post-deadlock. #### Thoughts: To capture trades and maintain favorable margins as volatility increases, I must stay close to the seller floor without overpaying, leveraging the competitive environment to extract better prices. #### Updated Strategy: Bid $96.25 to stay competitive with top buyers and signal strong intent, aiming to entice flexible sellers while preserving a reasonable profit margin. Monitor for further seller undercutting and be ready to adjust quickly.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $95.50, adjusting downward to capture improved profit potential while remaining competitive after last hour's successful trade. Market participants are recalibrating following the breakthrough in trades.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I raised my bid to $96.25 to match the more competitive market environment as sellers continue to lower their asks, with Mia remaining the lowest at $97.00. No trades executed yet this hour.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I increased my bid to $96.60, surpassing the previous top bid to regain a leading position and target sellers near the current ask floor. The bid-ask spread remains tight, and market activity is focused on incremental movements.

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Tara at $97.15





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid queue is extremely competitive, with buyers moving in small increments and sellers holding firm just above $96.98. No trades have occurred since the flurry in Hour 15. #### Thoughts: Maintaining top queue position is critical, but aggressive bidding could erode profit quickly. The market may remain tense until either a seller capitulates or a buyer becomes desperate. #### Updated Strategy: Continue leading the bid queue with small, calculated increases, carefully watching for signs of capitulation from sellers or sudden moves from buyers. Stay ready to adjust if a trade window opens or if competitors act aggressively.

# Market Rules

- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $95.50, adjusting downward to capture improved profit potential while remaining competitive after last hour's successful trade. Market participants are recalibrating following the breakthrough in trades.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I raised my bid to $96.25 to match the more competitive market environment as sellers continue to lower their asks, with Mia remaining the lowest at $97.00. No trades executed yet this hour.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I increased my bid to $96.60, surpassing the previous top bid to regain a leading position and target sellers near the current ask floor. The bid-ask spread remains tight, and market activity is focused on incremental movements.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I raised my bid to $96.27, narrowly surpassing Buyer Jun to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue. The market remains highly competitive with sellers holding their ask prices just above $96.98 and no trades executed so far.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I increased my bid to $96.64 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jun and reclaim the top position in the bid queue, maintaining pressure on the ask floor while protecting profit margin.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I increased my bid to $96.94 to reclaim the top position in the bid queue, narrowly surpassing Buyer Max while keeping close to the ask floor. No trades have occurred yet as sellers continue to hold their prices.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I increased my bid to $96.96, narrowly surpassing the top bid cluster and matching Seller Kai's lowest ask, positioning myself for a potential trade if a seller lowers their price.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I placed a bid of $96.97, narrowly surpassing all competing buyers and matching the recent ask floor, positioning myself for a potential trade if sellers lower their ask or capitulate.

#### Observations: The bid-ask spread remains razor-thin, with buyers tightly clustered and sellers showing minimal downward movement. A trade executed at $96.95 last hour signals growing seller flexibility. #### Thoughts: The market is at a critical inflection point—competition is fierce and trades are likely to go to the most aggressive micro-increment bidder. Staying just ahead of the pack maximizes my execution odds. #### Updated Strategy: Use tight increments to always lead the bid queue, matching or barely exceeding the lowest ask to trigger trades. Monitor for sudden seller capitulation and avoid overbidding beyond the true value threshold.

Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $95.50, adjusting downward to capture improved profit potential while remaining competitive after last hour's successful trade. Market participants are recalibrating following the breakthrough in trades.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I raised my bid to $96.25 to match the more competitive market environment as sellers continue to lower their asks, with Mia remaining the lowest at $97.00. No trades executed yet this hour.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I increased my bid to $96.60, surpassing the previous top bid to regain a leading position and target sellers near the current ask floor. The bid-ask spread remains tight, and market activity is focused on incremental movements.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I raised my bid to $96.27, narrowly surpassing Buyer Jun to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue. The market remains highly competitive with sellers holding their ask prices just above $96.98 and no trades executed so far.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I increased my bid to $96.64 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jun and reclaim the top position in the bid queue, maintaining pressure on the ask floor while protecting profit margin.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I increased my bid to $96.94 to reclaim the top position in the bid queue, narrowly surpassing Buyer Max while keeping close to the ask floor. No trades have occurred yet as sellers continue to hold their prices.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I increased my bid to $96.96, narrowly surpassing the top bid cluster and matching Seller Kai's lowest ask, positioning myself for a potential trade if a seller lowers their price.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I placed a bid of $96.97, narrowly surpassing all competing buyers and matching the recent ask floor, positioning myself for a potential trade if sellers lower their ask or capitulate.
Hour 24: In Hour #24, I raised my bid to $96.98, directly matching Seller Kai's lowest ask and surpassing the buyer cluster at $96.97, seeking to trigger a trade as the market tightens further.
Hour 25: In Hour #25, I raised my bid to $96.99, narrowly surpassing the current bid cluster and matching Seller Leo's lowest ask. The market remains highly competitive, with buyers and sellers both tightly clustered around the $96.98–$96.99 range.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyers are tightly clustered at $96.98, and the lowest ask is now $96.99. Sellers have shown slight downward movement, with occasional trades when buyers match or slightly exceed asks. The spread is minimal and the risk of missing a trade is rising as the time horizon shortens. #### Thoughts: Incremental bidding remains vital to avoid being leapfrogged by other buyers. As the auction nears its end, sellers are likely to accept bids at the ask or just above. Profit preservation is still important, but execution risk is now a top concern. #### Updated Strategy: Place bids that narrowly exceed the highest bid and match or slightly exceed the lowest ask to maximize execution odds. Stay vigilant for sudden shifts in ask prices, and avoid exceeding true value. Prepare for faster moves if sellers drop further or buyers become more aggressive.

Hour 23: In Hour #23, I placed a bid of $96.97, narrowly surpassing all competing buyers and matching the recent ask floor, positioning myself for a potential trade if sellers lower their ask or capitulate.
Hour 24: In Hour #24, I raised my bid to $96.98, directly matching Seller Kai's lowest ask and surpassing the buyer cluster at $96.97, seeking to trigger a trade as the market tightens further.
Hour 25: In Hour #25, I raised my bid to $96.99, narrowly surpassing the current bid cluster and matching Seller Leo's lowest ask. The market remains highly competitive, with buyers and sellers both tightly clustered around the $96.98–$96.99 range.
Hour 26: In Hour #26, I placed a bid of $97.00, surpassing the $96.99 cluster and matching Seller Mia's ask, positioning myself for a high likelihood of trade execution as the bid-ask spread tightens further.
Hour 27: In Hour #27, I placed a bid of $97.01, narrowly surpassing the current bid cluster to reclaim the top spot and maximize execution probability as the market remains tightly contested near the ask floor.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Tara at $97.15





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread is now just $0.01–$0.02, with rapid trade execution for buyers who take the top bid. Sellers are reluctant to drop asks below $97.00, and buyers are incrementally raising bids to secure trades. #### Thoughts: With three hours left, securing a trade is increasingly urgent, and being first in the queue is critical. Buyers who hesitate risk missing out entirely. Margins are thin, but the risk of no trade outweighs small profit sacrifices. #### Updated Strategy: Place a $97.01 bid to ensure top queue position. Be ready to adapt quickly if another buyer jumps the queue, and consider more aggressive moves if the ask drops or competition intensifies in the final hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory

Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.

Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.

Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I placed a bid of $95.50, adjusting downward to capture improved profit potential while remaining competitive after last hour's successful trade. Market participants are recalibrating following the breakthrough in trades.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I raised my bid to $96.25 to match the more competitive market environment as sellers continue to lower their asks, with Mia remaining the lowest at $97.00. No trades executed yet this hour.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I increased my bid to $96.60, surpassing the previous top bid to regain a leading position and target sellers near the current ask floor. The bid-ask spread remains tight, and market activity is focused on incremental movements.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I raised my bid to $96.27, narrowly surpassing Buyer Jun to reclaim the top spot in the bid queue. The market remains highly competitive with sellers holding their ask prices just above $96.98 and no trades executed so far.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I increased my bid to $96.64 to narrowly surpass Buyer Jun and reclaim the top position in the bid queue, maintaining pressure on the ask floor while protecting profit margin.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Tara at $97.15
Hour 29: You bought from Seller Leo at $97.03





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The market remains hyper-competitive, with buyers and sellers both tightly clustered around the $97.00 mark. Aggressive, incremental bidding has become the norm, and executed trades are going to those who preempt rivals by a cent. Only two hours remain, amplifying urgency. #### Thoughts: Margins are thin but acceptable given the high risk of missing a trade. Outbidding the $97.03 cluster is essential to maximize execution probability. Seller ask reductions could occur if buyers push higher. #### Updated Strategy: Aggressively bid $97.04 to secure the top position and maximize trade execution chances, remaining ready to respond quickly in the final hour if rivals counter-bid.

{
  "reflection": "The aggressive incremental bidding strategy in the last several hours ensured continuous top queue placement and resulted in a successful trade last hour, albeit at a thin margin. However, with only two trades executed all day, the risk of not securing a final hour trade due to being outbid or a sudden ask drop remains high. The primary improvement would have been to anticipate and preempt rivals by more than a single cent in the final stretch, increasing the chance of trade execution.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "As this is the last hour, securing one final trade is critical\u2014there will be no further opportunities. All buyers are highly competitive and incremental bidding is the dominant strategy. To maximize the probability of execution, I will bid $97.06, two cents above the current top bid ($97.04), surpassing Buyer Amir and creating a clear lead. This aggressive move should discourage immediate leapfrogging and ensures my bid is most likely to match if any seller lowers their ask in the final hour.",
  "bid": 97.06,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #30, I placed a decisive bid of $97.06, surpassing the $97.04 cluster to establish a clear lead in the queue as the market enters its final hour, maximizing my chances for a last trade.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: The market is at its most competitive, with buyers clustered tightly and sellers holding just above recent trade prices. Final hour urgency is extremely high and rivals may attempt last-minute outbidding. #### Thoughts: Margins are secondary to execution, as missing the final trade is the worst outcome. A two-cent increment above the top cluster creates psychological and competitive separation, reducing the chance of being leapfrogged. #### Updated Strategy: Bid $97.06 to establish a clear lead, maximize trade execution probability, and close the market with minimal risk of being outbid in this final round."
