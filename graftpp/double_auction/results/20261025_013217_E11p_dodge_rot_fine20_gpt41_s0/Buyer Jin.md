# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid-ask spread remains wide, and all buyers—including myself—are tied at $83.98; sellers are still not lowering their asks. No trades have occurred. #### Thoughts: The market is entrenched in a standoff, with all participants waiting for a catalyst. My conservative incremental increases are not motivating sellers. The risk of missing out on trades grows as we approach the midpoint of the auction. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain the $83.98 bid this hour to preserve my position. If there is no movement by Hour 9, consider a more aggressive bid or temporarily withdrawing to test for a response from sellers.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers have held firm above $97.20, and buyers’ incremental increases have failed to trigger any trades. My withdrawal last hour had no visible effect on the spread or bid/ask behavior. Time is running out to secure trades. #### Thoughts: The continuous inaction suggests entrenched positions. To avoid missing out, I must regain market presence while still maintaining negotiating leverage. #### Updated Strategy: Re-enter as the top bidder to reassert my presence and monitor for any resulting shifts in market dynamics. If sellers do not respond and time keeps running down, I will consider more aggressive moves in subsequent hours to ensure trades are made before the deadline.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.

With only two hours left, the risk of no trades is acute. #### Thoughts: The conservative approach has maximized potential margin but failed to yield deals. Other buyers are becoming more aggressive, and I must act decisively to secure at least one trade and avoid a shutout. #### Updated Strategy: Make a substantial bid increase to $90.00 to test seller resolve and attempt to trigger a trade. If sellers remain unmoved, be prepared for a final, aggressive bid in Hour 15, potentially approaching my true value if needed to secure a trade before the market closes.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Tara at $97.15
Hour 16: You bought from Seller Kai at $97.14
Hour 17: You bought from Seller Leo at $97.1





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers' lowest asks remain clustered at $97.10 and $97.14, with other buyers having dropped to lower bids after missing out last round. My previous aggressive bids secured trades but left limited profit margin. #### Thoughts: With diminished buyer competition, I can afford to edge just above the ask floor and potentially secure another lot at a slightly better price, optimizing profit while still prioritizing execution. #### Updated Strategy: Bid $97.11 to be the top buyer and closely match the lowest seller, maximizing execution odds and profit per lot. Monitor for renewed buyer aggression or sudden seller capitulation, ready to adjust bid accordingly.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I increased my bid to $97.18, positioning myself at the top of the bid queue to capitalize on potential seller movement, following the flurry of trades in the previous hour.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $97.11 to narrowly top the current ask floor and maximize trade execution probability as other buyers retreated to lower bids. The market remains competitive with sellers holding their price levels.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I increased my bid to $97.14 to match the lowest ask and maximize the likelihood of trade execution as other buyers remained at lower bids.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers persist at a $97.14 ask floor, showing no willingness to lower prices; buyers remain far below the ask, resulting in little competition for the top trade position. Trades are reliably executed when matching the ask. #### Thoughts: The market is in a holding pattern, with sellers disciplined and buyers passive. There is little incentive to underbid or test seller flexibility at this time, as it risks missing trades with no sign of lower prices. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain my bid at $97.14 to ensure consistent trade execution. Monitor for any sudden bid increases or ask reductions; be prepared to strategically adjust if competition intensifies or if sellers signal price flexibility.

# Market Rules

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers continue to enforce a $97.14 price floor, with no price movement among either sellers or buyers over several hours. My bids at this level have reliably secured trades. #### Thoughts: The market is locked in a stable equilibrium, and deviating from the $97.14 bid risks missing out on trades with no upside. The absence of aggressive buyer behavior indicates little chance of being outbid, while sellers remain unyielding. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $97.14 to guarantee executions unless there is a clear shift in either ask or bid patterns. Monitor for signs of last-minute competition or any breakdown in seller discipline as the market approaches its final hours, and be prepared to adjust quickly if conditions change.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I increased my bid to $97.18, positioning myself at the top of the bid queue to capitalize on potential seller movement, following the flurry of trades in the previous hour.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $97.11 to narrowly top the current ask floor and maximize trade execution probability as other buyers retreated to lower bids. The market remains competitive with sellers holding their price levels.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I increased my bid to $97.14 to match the lowest ask and maximize the likelihood of trade execution as other buyers remained at lower bids.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I maintained my bid at $97.14 to match the ask floor, aiming to secure another lot amid static seller pricing and low buyer competition.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I maintained my bid at $97.14, matching the ask floor to continue securing trades as other buyers stayed well below the ask and sellers remained firm.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I maintained my bid at $97.14 to match the ask floor as sellers held their prices and buyers stayed below; the market remained stable and my position ensured trade priority.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I maintained my bid at $97.14 to match the seller ask floor, ensuring continued trade priority as both sellers and other buyers held their positions and market dynamics remained unchanged.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I maintained my $97.14 bid to match the seller floor and ensure trade priority as both sellers and buyers kept their prices stable with no significant changes.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I increased my bid to $97.18, positioning myself at the top of the bid queue to capitalize on potential seller movement, following the flurry of trades in the previous hour.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $97.11 to narrowly top the current ask floor and maximize trade execution probability as other buyers retreated to lower bids. The market remains competitive with sellers holding their price levels.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I increased my bid to $97.14 to match the lowest ask and maximize the likelihood of trade execution as other buyers remained at lower bids.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I maintained my bid at $97.14 to match the ask floor, aiming to secure another lot amid static seller pricing and low buyer competition.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I maintained my bid at $97.14, matching the ask floor to continue securing trades as other buyers stayed well below the ask and sellers remained firm.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I maintained my bid at $97.14 to match the ask floor as sellers held their prices and buyers stayed below; the market remained stable and my position ensured trade priority.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I maintained my bid at $97.14 to match the seller ask floor, ensuring continued trade priority as both sellers and other buyers held their positions and market dynamics remained unchanged.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I maintained my $97.14 bid to match the seller floor and ensure trade priority as both sellers and buyers kept their prices stable with no significant changes.
Hour 24: In Hour #24, I maintained my bid at $97.14, remaining the top buyer as both sellers and other buyers held steady; the market equilibrium persisted with no notable shifts.
Hour 25: In Hour #25, I maintained my bid at $97.14, keeping the top position as both sellers and buyers held steady at their established price points. The market continues to show no significant changes or new entrants.

The market is stable but could shift as the end approaches. #### Thoughts: My continued dominance at $97.14 is yielding steady trades, but as we near the final hours, competitors may become more aggressive. I must remain alert for endgame volatility, including late surges from buyers or sudden changes in seller pricing. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain the $97.14 bid to ensure trade execution unless challenged by another buyer or if sellers move their asks. Watch closely for any late-game strategic shifts and be prepared to outbid competitors by a minimal increment if necessary.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I increased my bid to $97.18, positioning myself at the top of the bid queue to capitalize on potential seller movement, following the flurry of trades in the previous hour.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $97.11 to narrowly top the current ask floor and maximize trade execution probability as other buyers retreated to lower bids. The market remains competitive with sellers holding their price levels.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I increased my bid to $97.14 to match the lowest ask and maximize the likelihood of trade execution as other buyers remained at lower bids.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I maintained my bid at $97.14 to match the ask floor, aiming to secure another lot amid static seller pricing and low buyer competition.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I maintained my bid at $97.14, matching the ask floor to continue securing trades as other buyers stayed well below the ask and sellers remained firm.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I maintained my bid at $97.14 to match the ask floor as sellers held their prices and buyers stayed below; the market remained stable and my position ensured trade priority.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I maintained my bid at $97.14 to match the seller ask floor, ensuring continued trade priority as both sellers and other buyers held their positions and market dynamics remained unchanged.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I maintained my $97.14 bid to match the seller floor and ensure trade priority as both sellers and buyers kept their prices stable with no significant changes.
Hour 24: In Hour #24, I maintained my bid at $97.14, remaining the top buyer as both sellers and other buyers held steady; the market equilibrium persisted with no notable shifts.
Hour 25: In Hour #25, I maintained my bid at $97.14, keeping the top position as both sellers and buyers held steady at their established price points. The market continues to show no significant changes or new entrants.
Hour 26: In Hour #26, I increased my bid to $97.15 to narrowly outbid Buyer Max and maintain top position as competition intensified, while sellers held their ask floor at $97.14.
Hour 27: In Hour #27, I increased my bid to $97.16 to reclaim exclusive lead in the bid queue as buyer competition at $97.15 intensified. The seller floor remains unchanged and no significant shift in ask pricing was observed.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer Max continues to match my bids at the seller floor, escalating competition for available lots. Seller prices remain static at $97.14-$97.20, and no new sellers have entered. #### Thoughts: With only a few hours left, maintaining the top bid is critical to trade volume, as even a $0.01 increment ensures trade priority. The risk of overbidding is minimal compared to the risk of losing trade opportunities in the final hours. #### Updated Strategy: Incrementally increase my bid to $97.16 to stay ahead of competing buyers. Monitor Max and other buyers for further escalation, and be prepared for additional small bid increments if needed to secure final hour trades.

## Prompt: Round 30 - 2026-10-25 01:33:21.556624

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Jin. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Quantum Defense Systems as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I placed a bid of $82.87, slightly over the previous third-highest bid, to test the market's response while maintaining a conservative stance. No trades were made this hour.
Hour 2: In Hour 2, I increased my bid to $83.81, narrowly outbidding the previous top bidder. The spread remains wide and sellers have not lowered their asks. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 3: In Hour 3, I raised my bid to $83.91, surpassing Buyer Amir to secure the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains unchanged with sellers holding their ground, and no trades have occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour 4, I raised my bid slightly to $83.93 to preserve the top bid position. The market remains at a standoff with sellers holding their price floor and no trades executed.
Hour 5: In Hour 5, I increased my bid to $83.95, securing the top bid position. The bid-ask spread remains wide as sellers hold firm and no trades have occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour 6, I increased my bid to $83.97, maintaining my position as the top buyer while the sellers held firm on their asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour 7, I raised my bid to $83.98 to maintain the top position in the bid queue. No trades occurred as sellers continued to hold firm, and the spread remains wide.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I maintained my bid at $83.98, holding the top position in the bid queue along with other buyers. The market remains at a standoff, with no trades executed and sellers holding their asks.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I raised my bid to $84.00, surpassing the $83.99 cluster to reclaim the top bid position. No trades have occurred, and sellers continue to hold their ask prices.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I withdrew my $84.00 bid to break the buyer stalemate and test if sellers or other buyers would shift their pricing strategies in response. No trades occurred, and market tension persists.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I re-entered the bid queue with a top bid of $84.05, surpassing all current buyers to test if a small increase prompts any seller or buyer response. No trades have occurred, and the ask prices remain unchanged.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised my bid to $84.10 to reclaim clear lead position in the bid queue. There were no trades, and the ask prices from sellers remained unchanged, indicating continued market deadlock.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I increased my bid to $84.20, maintaining the lead in the bid queue while sellers held their positions and no trades occurred.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I raised my bid sharply to $90.00, making a decisive move to break the long-standing deadlock and signal strong intent to sellers. The market remains tense, with the spread narrowed but still no trades executed.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I raised my bid to $97.15 to aggressively pursue a trade as the market closes, aiming to break the seller stalemate and avoid ending without a deal.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, I increased my bid to $97.18, positioning myself at the top of the bid queue to capitalize on potential seller movement, following the flurry of trades in the previous hour.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I placed a bid of $97.11 to narrowly top the current ask floor and maximize trade execution probability as other buyers retreated to lower bids. The market remains competitive with sellers holding their price levels.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I increased my bid to $97.14 to match the lowest ask and maximize the likelihood of trade execution as other buyers remained at lower bids.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I maintained my bid at $97.14 to match the ask floor, aiming to secure another lot amid static seller pricing and low buyer competition.
Hour 20: In Hour #20, I maintained my bid at $97.14, matching the ask floor to continue securing trades as other buyers stayed well below the ask and sellers remained firm.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I maintained my bid at $97.14 to match the ask floor as sellers held their prices and buyers stayed below; the market remained stable and my position ensured trade priority.
Hour 22: In Hour #22, I maintained my bid at $97.14 to match the seller ask floor, ensuring continued trade priority as both sellers and other buyers held their positions and market dynamics remained unchanged.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I maintained my $97.14 bid to match the seller floor and ensure trade priority as both sellers and buyers kept their prices stable with no significant changes.

Hour 28: In Hour #28, I raised my bid to $97.17 to stay ahead of Buyer Max and Nia, ensuring top placement in the bid queue as seller prices remained unchanged and buyer competition intensified.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyer rivalry continues to intensify, with Max and Nia consistently matching top bids. Seller prices remain fixed at $97.14-$97.20, with no new sellers entering the market. #### Thoughts: With only two hours remaining, incremental increases are necessary to secure trades and avoid last-moment losses to aggressive buyers. Margins are tight, but trade volume is paramount. #### Updated Strategy: Increase my bid to $97.18 this hour to keep the lead and watch for immediate reactions from Max, Nia, or Jun. Be prepared to raise by another cent in the final hour if competition persists, prioritizing trade security over marginal profit.

  "reflection": "My incremental bid increases have successfully maintained trade priority despite heightened competition from Max and Nia. However, with the final hour upon us, the risk of being outbid in the last minute is substantial. While my margins have tightened, securing the final trade is more important than attempting to squeeze out the last cent of profit.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "To guarantee top position in the bid queue and mitigate the risk of being leapfrogged by aggressive buyers in the closing moments, I will bid $97.19\u2014one cent above my previous bid and just one cent below Seller Tara's $97.20 ask. This positions me optimally for trade execution without overpaying, and ensures maximum likelihood of capturing the last lot available.",
  "bid": 97.19,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #30, I placed a bid of $97.19 to secure the top position in the bid queue and maximize the probability of executing a final trade as the market concludes, while monitoring for last-second moves from rival buyers.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: Buyer rivalry is at its peak, with Max, Nia, and Jun consistently matching or narrowly undercutting leading bids. Seller ask prices remain at $97.14\u2013$97.20 and no new sellers have emerged. The final hour presents heightened risk of being outbid at the last moment.\n#### Thoughts: The priority now is ensuring trade execution rather than marginal profit improvement. The potential cost of missing a final trade outweighs the benefit of saving a cent or two per lot.\n#### Updated Strategy: Bid $97.19\u2014just below the highest ask\u2014to secure queue position and deter last-minute overbids. Monitor for any late aggressive actions from other buyers, but avoid exceeding $97.20 to preserve a minimum margin."
