# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The ask prices remain stubbornly high and unchanged, with no trades across eight hours. Buyers are inching up bids, but sellers are not responding. #### Thoughts: My strategy of gradual increases has preserved margin but yielded no trades, and the clock is ticking on the trading period. If this deadlock persists into later hours, I may need to consider a more aggressive move. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental bid increases to maintain a leading queue position without sacrificing too much margin. Monitor closely for any shifts among sellers or buyers. Be ready to accelerate bid increases or consider withdrawal if market dynamics shift unexpectedly.

With no market movement from sellers, a more assertive bid increment could be necessary to test their resolve. #### Updated Strategy: Increase my bid more noticeably to $83.80 to maintain a strong position and potentially encourage sellers to reconsider, but avoid large jumps that would erode profit margin too quickly.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $81.92, positioned in the middle of the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.31; no trades occurred.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I increased my bid slightly to $82.82, becoming the highest bidder, while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid at $82.95, outbidding all others to claim the top spot in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I increased my bid to $82.98, keeping the top bid position; the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.06 to maintain the top position in the bid queue, as the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised my bid to $83.15 to maintain a strong position near the top of the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and still no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.50, positioning myself between Buyer Kit and Buyer Ana in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged, and still no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $83.66, moving just above Buyer Kit and maintaining a strong position in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid at $83.80, moving ahead of Buyer Kit and close to Buyer Ana, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $81.92, positioned in the middle of the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.31; no trades occurred.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I increased my bid slightly to $82.82, becoming the highest bidder, while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid at $82.95, outbidding all others to claim the top spot in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I increased my bid to $82.98, keeping the top bid position; the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.06 to maintain the top position in the bid queue, as the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised my bid to $83.15 to maintain a strong position near the top of the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and still no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.50, positioning myself between Buyer Kit and Buyer Ana in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged, and still no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $83.66, moving just above Buyer Kit and maintaining a strong position in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid at $83.80, moving ahead of Buyer Kit and close to Buyer Ana, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased my bid to $83.95, positioning just below Buyer Ana and above Buyer Kit, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $84.60, surpassing Buyer Ana to take the top position in the bid queue, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $85.60, overtaking Ana for the highest bid and clearly signaling a willingness to pay more, as sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred yet.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $81.92, positioned in the middle of the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.31; no trades occurred.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I increased my bid slightly to $82.82, becoming the highest bidder, while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid at $82.95, outbidding all others to claim the top spot in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I increased my bid to $82.98, keeping the top bid position; the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.06 to maintain the top position in the bid queue, as the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised my bid to $83.15 to maintain a strong position near the top of the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and still no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.50, positioning myself between Buyer Kit and Buyer Ana in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged, and still no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $83.66, moving just above Buyer Kit and maintaining a strong position in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid at $83.80, moving ahead of Buyer Kit and close to Buyer Ana, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased my bid to $83.95, positioning just below Buyer Ana and above Buyer Kit, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $84.60, surpassing Buyer Ana to take the top position in the bid queue, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $85.60, overtaking Ana for the highest bid and clearly signaling a willingness to pay more, as sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bold bid at $88.00, significantly above my previous bid, to strongly signal urgency and attempt to provoke movement from sellers, who continue to hold firm above $95. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bold bid of $92.00, substantially ahead of all other buyers, to force sellers' attention and attempt to provoke a trade as the deadline looms.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed an aggressive bid of $95.25, matching the lowest ask to guarantee a trade as the auction closes, prioritizing trade execution over margin.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Raj at $94.17





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are holding firm just above $94.00, referencing recent trade prices. Multiple buyers are clustering bids around $93.50-$94.00, increasing competition. No trades occurred last hour despite several buyers vying for position. #### Thoughts: The competitive landscape remains tight, with sellers waiting for buyers to bridge the remaining spread. Margins are thin, and aggressive moves may be needed to secure trades as other buyers act quickly. #### Updated Strategy: Incrementally increase my bid to $94.00 to stay ahead of most competitors and maximize my chances for a trade while keeping some profit margin. Monitor if sellers capitulate or if further upward movement is required in subsequent hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.

- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: Hour #1 opened with my bid at $81.92, positioned in the middle of the bid queue, while the lowest ask is $96.31; no trades occurred.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I increased my bid slightly to $82.82, becoming the highest bidder, while the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I placed a bid at $82.95, outbidding all others to claim the top spot in the bid queue; sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I increased my bid to $82.98, keeping the top bid position; the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I increased my bid to $83.06 to maintain the top position in the bid queue, as the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I raised my bid to $83.15 to maintain a strong position near the top of the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and still no trades occurred.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised my bid to $83.50, positioning myself between Buyer Kit and Buyer Ana in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged, and still no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I placed a bid at $83.66, moving just above Buyer Kit and maintaining a strong position in the bid queue; the ask prices remained unchanged and no trades occurred.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I placed a bid at $83.80, moving ahead of Buyer Kit and close to Buyer Ana, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I increased my bid to $83.95, positioning just below Buyer Ana and above Buyer Kit, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised my bid to $84.60, surpassing Buyer Ana to take the top position in the bid queue, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $85.60, overtaking Ana for the highest bid and clearly signaling a willingness to pay more, as sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bold bid at $88.00, significantly above my previous bid, to strongly signal urgency and attempt to provoke movement from sellers, who continue to hold firm above $95. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bold bid of $92.00, substantially ahead of all other buyers, to force sellers' attention and attempt to provoke a trade as the deadline looms.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed an aggressive bid of $95.25, matching the lowest ask to guarantee a trade as the auction closes, prioritizing trade execution over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I re-entered the market with a bid of $93.50 as the queues were empty, aiming to test seller pricing behavior post-trade and to rebuild margin after last hour's thin profit.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I increased my bid to $94.00 to position near the top of the bid queue, aiming to entice sellers with asks clustered just above and to remain competitive as buyers test the new post-trade price band.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I increased my bid to $94.26, overtaking all other buyers in the queue; sellers maintained asks at $94.5 and above, and no trades occurred during this hour.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are steadfast at $94.25–$94.50, and buyers are increasingly aggressive, bidding up to $94.25 last hour. No trades occurred as the spread remained unclosed. #### Thoughts: Aggressive bidding is now the only way to secure trades, as buyers are converging on the ask threshold. The risk of not transacting increases as competition intensifies; securing a position at the top of the bid queue is critical. #### Updated Strategy: Bid $94.26 to surpass all buyers and challenge the lowest seller; be prepared to raise further if sellers continue holding.

Hour 20: You bought from Seller Lena at $94.38





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are firmly anchored at $94.25–$94.50, with Seller Yara consistently posting at $94.50 and others rarely going lower. Buyer aggression is high, and most trades occur when buyers match or slightly exceed the lowest ask. #### Thoughts: The risk of missing out on trades is greater than the incremental loss in margin from small bid increases. Remaining below $94.50 risks being leapfrogged by other aggressive buyers. #### Updated Strategy: Bid $94.50 to directly match the lowest available ask and secure the next trade opportunity. Continue to monitor seller behavior and be ready to increase if sellers or buyers escalate further, prioritizing trade execution over minor margin optimization.

{
  "reflection": "Aggressive bidding at $94.50 in recent hours has consistently secured trades, though margins remain thin. The consistent presence of sellers at $94.25-$94.50 and immediate buyer competition means that any hesitation risks being leapfrogged and missing trades. However, repeated matching at $94.50 may slightly overpay compared to the $94.25-$94.38 range seen in actual trades. There is minimal evidence sellers will drop below $94.25, so patience for lower fills is unlikely to be rewarded.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Maintain a bid at $94.50 to directly challenge Seller Yara, remaining first in the bid queue for immediate execution if sellers accept or if other buyers escalate. This maximizes the likelihood of a trade while protecting against being edged out by similarly aggressive buyers. Monitor for any sign of sellers lowering to $94.25, but don't risk falling back in the queue while buyer aggression remains high.",

Most trades settle between $94.25 and $94.38, but matching $94.50 remains the surest route to execution. Buyer competition is intense, with several buyers willing to match or outbid at $94.50. #### Thoughts: The marginal loss from overpaying by a few cents is outweighed by the risk of missing a trade entirely as the deadline approaches. There is little incentive for sellers to lower asks further, given persistent buyer demand. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $94.50 to secure trades, but remain vigilant for any abrupt changes in seller behavior or a sudden drop in ask prices. Be ready to adapt if sellers soften or buyers withdraw, but prioritize trade execution over marginal improvements in price."

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers are firmly anchored between $94.25 and $94.50, with Yara reliably posting $94.50 and no downward movement despite frequent trades. Buyer activity remains aggressive, with multiple contenders staying within cents of the top bid. Most trades are executing at $94.25–$94.38 or at the $94.50 level for guaranteed fills. #### Thoughts: The risk of missing a trade outweighs the marginal benefit of bidding lower, given strong buyer demand and static seller asks. As the auction moves toward its close, the priority remains on trade execution over squeezing out a few extra cents. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $94.50 to reliably secure trades, but remain alert for any abrupt market shifts. If sellers suddenly lower asks or buyers exit, be ready to adjust downward to protect margin; otherwise, maintain the current approach for consistent fills.

Margins are thin but stable.

Maintain flexibility, but prioritize fills as the auction approaches its final hours."

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bold bid of $92.00, substantially ahead of all other buyers, to force sellers' attention and attempt to provoke a trade as the deadline looms.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed an aggressive bid of $95.25, matching the lowest ask to guarantee a trade as the auction closes, prioritizing trade execution over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I re-entered the market with a bid of $93.50 as the queues were empty, aiming to test seller pricing behavior post-trade and to rebuild margin after last hour's thin profit.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I increased my bid to $94.00 to position near the top of the bid queue, aiming to entice sellers with asks clustered just above and to remain competitive as buyers test the new post-trade price band.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I increased my bid to $94.26, overtaking all other buyers in the queue; sellers maintained asks at $94.5 and above, and no trades occurred during this hour.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers continue to anchor at $94.25 and $94.50, with no sign of capitulation. Buyer demand is strong, with multiple bids clustered just below my own. Trades consistently execute at $94.33–$94.38, but $94.50 remains the only secure fill price. #### Thoughts: The risk of losing out on trades by bidding lower outweighs the small margin benefit of undercutting by a penny or two. Sellers are disciplined and buyers are aggressive, so execution is the priority. #### Updated Strategy: Hold at $94.50 unless there is a clear reduction in asks. Monitor closely for any collapse in seller pricing or drop in buyer intensity. Be ready to react instantly to any shift, but stay firm to maximize fills as the auction nears its end.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 12: In Hour #12, I placed a bid of $85.60, overtaking Ana for the highest bid and clearly signaling a willingness to pay more, as sellers maintained their ask prices and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I placed a bold bid at $88.00, significantly above my previous bid, to strongly signal urgency and attempt to provoke movement from sellers, who continue to hold firm above $95. No trades have occurred yet.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bold bid of $92.00, substantially ahead of all other buyers, to force sellers' attention and attempt to provoke a trade as the deadline looms.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed an aggressive bid of $95.25, matching the lowest ask to guarantee a trade as the auction closes, prioritizing trade execution over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I re-entered the market with a bid of $93.50 as the queues were empty, aiming to test seller pricing behavior post-trade and to rebuild margin after last hour's thin profit.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I increased my bid to $94.00 to position near the top of the bid queue, aiming to entice sellers with asks clustered just above and to remain competitive as buyers test the new post-trade price band.
Hour 18: In Hour #18, I increased my bid to $94.26, overtaking all other buyers in the queue; sellers maintained asks at $94.5 and above, and no trades occurred during this hour.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I placed a bid of $94.51, overtaking all other buyers to challenge Seller Yara's $94.5 ask; the bid queue grew more aggressive as buyer competition intensified, with sellers holding firm.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I placed a bid of $94.50 to surpass all other buyers and directly challenge Seller Yara's ask, aiming to secure a trade as competition intensifies near the $94.50 level.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm at $94.25 and $94.50, with no downward movement. Buyers are tightly grouped, and trades continue to clear in the $94.38–$94.39 range. My $94.50 bid consistently secures trades. #### Thoughts: The opportunity cost of missing fills outweighs the marginal gain from trying to shave off a few cents, given the competitive environment and limited remaining hours. Sellers show no signs of capitulating further, and buyers are not retreating. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain $94.50 to ensure trade execution and maximize total inventory by Hour #30. Monitor closely for any signs of seller capitulation or sudden buyer exit that could justify a more aggressive margin strategy in the final hours.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bold bid of $92.00, substantially ahead of all other buyers, to force sellers' attention and attempt to provoke a trade as the deadline looms.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed an aggressive bid of $95.25, matching the lowest ask to guarantee a trade as the auction closes, prioritizing trade execution over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I re-entered the market with a bid of $93.50 as the queues were empty, aiming to test seller pricing behavior post-trade and to rebuild margin after last hour's thin profit.

Hour 18: In Hour #18, I increased my bid to $94.26, overtaking all other buyers in the queue; sellers maintained asks at $94.5 and above, and no trades occurred during this hour.
Hour 19: In Hour #19, I placed a bid of $94.51, overtaking all other buyers to challenge Seller Yara's $94.5 ask; the bid queue grew more aggressive as buyer competition intensified, with sellers holding firm.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain firm at $94.25 and $94.50, and my $94.50 bid has reliably resulted in fills, while lower bids have failed. Buyer competition is intense just below my bid, but sellers are not capitulating. #### Thoughts: There is no evidence sellers will lower prices, and with only three hours left, missing a trade would be more costly than a marginal increase in profit per lot. #### Updated Strategy: Continue bidding $94.50 to secure trades, closely monitor for any abrupt market shifts, and be prepared to react instantly if sellers suddenly move down or buyers back away.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Mia. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Velocity Turbines as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

Hour 14: In Hour #14, I placed a bold bid of $92.00, substantially ahead of all other buyers, to force sellers' attention and attempt to provoke a trade as the deadline looms.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed an aggressive bid of $95.25, matching the lowest ask to guarantee a trade as the auction closes, prioritizing trade execution over margin.
Hour 16: In Hour #16, I re-entered the market with a bid of $93.50 as the queues were empty, aiming to test seller pricing behavior post-trade and to rebuild margin after last hour's thin profit.
Hour 17: In Hour #17, I increased my bid to $94.00 to position near the top of the bid queue, aiming to entice sellers with asks clustered just above and to remain competitive as buyers test the new post-trade price band.

# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers continue to hold firm at $94.25 and $94.50; my $94.50 bid remains necessary to secure trades, while buyers vigorously compete just below but have not succeeded in lowering the clearing price. No evidence exists of imminent seller capitulation or reduced buyer aggression.
#### Thoughts: The cost of missing a trade now far outweighs the benefit of a marginally higher profit per lot. The stable, predictable supply from Amir at $94.38 has ended, so attention must shift to Yara and Raj, who are less predictable and may require higher bids to transact.
#### Updated Strategy: Maintain the $94.50 bid to ensure trade execution and queue priority. Continue to monitor for any last-minute shifts from sellers or buyers, but do not lower the bid unless a clear opportunity arises. Be prepared to respond instantly if market dynamics change in the final hour.

No late-hour capitulation or significant shifts from sellers or buyers occurred. #### Thoughts: With this being the final hour, the opportunity cost of missing a trade is absolute, so maintaining queue dominance is critical. The market dynamic has proven resistant to underbidding, and sellers have not shown any weakness at the close. #### Updated Strategy: Continue with the $94.50 bid to ensure trade execution in the last hour. Prioritize certainty of trade over marginal profit, as this is the last possible opportunity to transact."
