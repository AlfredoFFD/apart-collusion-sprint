# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I opened with a bid of 82.21, which was the lowest in the bid queue, while sellers’ asks started at 97.31, resulting in a wide spread and no trades.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised our bid to $83.00, positioning Solaris Energy above the lowest bid and closer to the bidding cluster, with the bid-ask spread still wide and no trades executed.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I increased our bid to $83.90, becoming the top bid, while both the bid and ask queues remained tightly clustered and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised our bid to $83.93, narrowly surpassing the top bid and maintaining our lead position in a still-inactive market with no trades and little movement from sellers.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised our bid to $83.94, overtaking the other buyers for the top queue position while sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.

Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99, retaking the top spot in a tightly packed bid cluster as sellers held firm with asks above $97.23 and the market remained inactive with no trades.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Buyers are tightly clustered at $83.97–$83.98, with Solaris Energy moving to $83.99 to stay on top. Sellers remain anchored above $97.23, keeping the spread wide. No trades have occurred, and no sellers have shown signs of capitulation. #### Thoughts: The standoff persists, with both sides signaling patience. Our incremental increases ensure queue priority if a seller suddenly accepts a lower price. There is still no evidence that aggressive bidding will be rewarded, but we must remain vigilant for any market shifts. #### Updated Strategy: Maintain slow, micro-incremental increases to preserve margin while maximizing trade readiness. Closely monitor for any reduction in ask prices or a break in the deadlock. Prepare for more decisive moves if trades do not materialize by Hour 10, but avoid unnecessary risk for now.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I opened with a bid of 82.21, which was the lowest in the bid queue, while sellers’ asks started at 97.31, resulting in a wide spread and no trades.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised our bid to $83.00, positioning Solaris Energy above the lowest bid and closer to the bidding cluster, with the bid-ask spread still wide and no trades executed.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I increased our bid to $83.90, becoming the top bid, while both the bid and ask queues remained tightly clustered and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised our bid to $83.93, narrowly surpassing the top bid and maintaining our lead position in a still-inactive market with no trades and little movement from sellers.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised our bid to $83.94, overtaking the other buyers for the top queue position while sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased our bid to $83.96, securing the top spot in the bid queue as buyers continued to slowly inch up their offers, while sellers held firm with no reduction in ask prices and still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.97, matching the highest bid and maintaining Solaris Energy at the top of the bid queue, while sellers kept their ask prices firm and no trades occurred.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid queue remains tightly packed with minimal movement, while sellers are completely unwilling to lower their asks, and no trades have taken place. Time pressure is mounting with only four rounds left. #### Thoughts: Incremental increases are not motivating sellers or triggering trades. If we continue the same strategy, we risk earning nothing. Other buyers may respond quickly to upward moves, so being more aggressive could be necessary. #### Updated Strategy: Escalate our bid by a larger margin this hour to $85.00, signaling seriousness and testing for any seller response. Continue to monitor for any shift in ask prices, and be prepared to further escalate if the market remains frozen. Consider more aggressive moves each subsequent hour if no trades occur.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #15 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I opened with a bid of 82.21, which was the lowest in the bid queue, while sellers’ asks started at 97.31, resulting in a wide spread and no trades.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised our bid to $83.00, positioning Solaris Energy above the lowest bid and closer to the bidding cluster, with the bid-ask spread still wide and no trades executed.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I increased our bid to $83.90, becoming the top bid, while both the bid and ask queues remained tightly clustered and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised our bid to $83.93, narrowly surpassing the top bid and maintaining our lead position in a still-inactive market with no trades and little movement from sellers.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised our bid to $83.94, overtaking the other buyers for the top queue position while sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased our bid to $83.96, securing the top spot in the bid queue as buyers continued to slowly inch up their offers, while sellers held firm with no reduction in ask prices and still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.97, matching the highest bid and maintaining Solaris Energy at the top of the bid queue, while sellers kept their ask prices firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99, retaking the top spot in a tightly packed bid cluster as sellers held firm with asks above $97.23 and the market remained inactive with no trades.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I maintained our bid at $83.99, keeping Solaris Energy at the top of a tightly clustered bid queue while sellers held firm with no reductions in their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I raised our bid to $84.02, surpassing all other buyers for top queue position, while sellers continued to hold their asks firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $85.00, marking a sharper increase in an attempt to break the persistent market deadlock as sellers continued to hold high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid sharply to $89.00 to aggressively challenge seller resistance, aiming to provoke a trade as the endgame nears and sellers remain inflexible.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

You have not made any successful trades yet - your profit is $0.00.





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers have remained rigid with their ask prices despite steadily increasing buyer bids, and no trades have occurred. The market has entered its critical phase with just two hours left. #### Thoughts: The lack of trades suggests sellers are counting on buyers to capitulate at the very end. Risk of no trades outweighs risk of low margin. #### Updated Strategy: Place a near-ask bid ($96.50) to force a reaction from sellers and capture at least one trade before the market closes. Be prepared to go even higher in the final hour if necessary to avoid a zero-profit outcome.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I opened with a bid of 82.21, which was the lowest in the bid queue, while sellers’ asks started at 97.31, resulting in a wide spread and no trades.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised our bid to $83.00, positioning Solaris Energy above the lowest bid and closer to the bidding cluster, with the bid-ask spread still wide and no trades executed.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I increased our bid to $83.90, becoming the top bid, while both the bid and ask queues remained tightly clustered and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised our bid to $83.93, narrowly surpassing the top bid and maintaining our lead position in a still-inactive market with no trades and little movement from sellers.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised our bid to $83.94, overtaking the other buyers for the top queue position while sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased our bid to $83.96, securing the top spot in the bid queue as buyers continued to slowly inch up their offers, while sellers held firm with no reduction in ask prices and still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.97, matching the highest bid and maintaining Solaris Energy at the top of the bid queue, while sellers kept their ask prices firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99, retaking the top spot in a tightly packed bid cluster as sellers held firm with asks above $97.23 and the market remained inactive with no trades.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I maintained our bid at $83.99, keeping Solaris Energy at the top of a tightly clustered bid queue while sellers held firm with no reductions in their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I raised our bid to $84.02, surpassing all other buyers for top queue position, while sellers continued to hold their asks firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $85.00, marking a sharper increase in an attempt to break the persistent market deadlock as sellers continued to hold high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid sharply to $89.00 to aggressively challenge seller resistance, aiming to provoke a trade as the endgame nears and sellers remain inflexible.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I raised our bid to $92.00, further escalating our offer to entice sellers, as the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades took place.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I escalated our bid sharply to $96.50, placing Solaris Energy just below the lowest ask to maximize the chance of provoking a trade as the market nears its close.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.17, surpassing the lowest ask to guarantee a trade as the market reached its final close, prioritizing execution over profit margin.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Leo at $96.84





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: After the market reset, sellers are holding high ask prices and buyers have reverted to conservative bids, creating a wide spread and stalling trading activity. #### Thoughts: It is too soon to return to aggressive bidding, but a modest re-entry above the buyer cluster may facilitate early seller movement or at least keep Solaris Energy in a favorable queue position. #### Updated Strategy: Gradually increase bid visibility while maintaining discipline; continue monitoring for any signs of weakening seller resolve or emergent buyer competition before escalating further.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I opened with a bid of 82.21, which was the lowest in the bid queue, while sellers’ asks started at 97.31, resulting in a wide spread and no trades.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised our bid to $83.00, positioning Solaris Energy above the lowest bid and closer to the bidding cluster, with the bid-ask spread still wide and no trades executed.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I increased our bid to $83.90, becoming the top bid, while both the bid and ask queues remained tightly clustered and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised our bid to $83.93, narrowly surpassing the top bid and maintaining our lead position in a still-inactive market with no trades and little movement from sellers.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised our bid to $83.94, overtaking the other buyers for the top queue position while sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased our bid to $83.96, securing the top spot in the bid queue as buyers continued to slowly inch up their offers, while sellers held firm with no reduction in ask prices and still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.97, matching the highest bid and maintaining Solaris Energy at the top of the bid queue, while sellers kept their ask prices firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99, retaking the top spot in a tightly packed bid cluster as sellers held firm with asks above $97.23 and the market remained inactive with no trades.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I maintained our bid at $83.99, keeping Solaris Energy at the top of a tightly clustered bid queue while sellers held firm with no reductions in their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I raised our bid to $84.02, surpassing all other buyers for top queue position, while sellers continued to hold their asks firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $85.00, marking a sharper increase in an attempt to break the persistent market deadlock as sellers continued to hold high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid sharply to $89.00 to aggressively challenge seller resistance, aiming to provoke a trade as the endgame nears and sellers remain inflexible.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I raised our bid to $92.00, further escalating our offer to entice sellers, as the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades took place.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I escalated our bid sharply to $96.50, placing Solaris Energy just below the lowest ask to maximize the chance of provoking a trade as the market nears its close.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.17, surpassing the lowest ask to guarantee a trade as the market reached its final close, prioritizing execution over profit margin.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, the market reset with both bid and ask queues empty; I chose not to place a bid, holding back to observe seller re-entry and possible softening of ask prices.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I re-entered the market with a moderate bid of $85.01, placing Solaris Energy just above the existing buyer cluster, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I increased our bid to $85.10, maintaining Solaris Energy at the lead of the bid queue as sellers kept high ask prices and no trades occurred.

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Leo at $96.84





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Sellers remain unyielding above $96.5, while buyers form a tight cluster just below. No trades have occurred for several hours, indicating a strong market impasse. #### Thoughts: Minor bid increments maintain top queue status, but continued inaction suggests only a significant move or a crack in seller discipline will prompt a trade. The risk of overpaying rises as rivals aggressively compete for execution. #### Updated Strategy: Continue incremental bid increases to maintain priority, but avoid major jumps unless sellers signal flexibility. Monitor for any reduction in lowest ask or sudden trade activity, and be prepared to escalate if a trade window opens.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

#### Observations: Sellers remain disciplined with asks clustered at or above $97.13, except Mia who occasionally offers at $96.5 and has completed trades there. Rival buyers are incrementally raising bids, with Nia securing recent trades at $96.5. #### Thoughts: Incremental increases alone are insufficient without matching the ask of flexible sellers like Mia. Missing further $96.5 trades may cost us profitable opportunities as the endgame nears. #### Updated Strategy: Bid $96.51 to top the queue and stand ready to match $96.5 if Mia or another seller softens again. Prioritize execution on these rare price dips, and be prepared to escalate quickly if rival buyers act aggressively. Continue close monitoring of ask queue movements.

This gives us priority over buyers at $96.51 and below, while minimizing the risk of overpaying. If Mia lists at $96.5 again, we will be best positioned for a trade. If no trade occurs, we can further adjust upward next hour if needed, but this approach balances execution and margin.",

Rival buyers are incrementally increasing bids but have not displaced Nia at $96.5. #### Thoughts: The key to capturing more profitable trades is to directly target Mia's flexible ask, as incremental bidding is insufficient for execution. Our willingness to match $96.5 is crucial in the short term. #### Updated Strategy: Aggressively target $96.5-$96.55, ensuring top bid queue position when Mia moves.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.


# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I opened with a bid of 82.21, which was the lowest in the bid queue, while sellers’ asks started at 97.31, resulting in a wide spread and no trades.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised our bid to $83.00, positioning Solaris Energy above the lowest bid and closer to the bidding cluster, with the bid-ask spread still wide and no trades executed.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I increased our bid to $83.90, becoming the top bid, while both the bid and ask queues remained tightly clustered and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised our bid to $83.93, narrowly surpassing the top bid and maintaining our lead position in a still-inactive market with no trades and little movement from sellers.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised our bid to $83.94, overtaking the other buyers for the top queue position while sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased our bid to $83.96, securing the top spot in the bid queue as buyers continued to slowly inch up their offers, while sellers held firm with no reduction in ask prices and still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.97, matching the highest bid and maintaining Solaris Energy at the top of the bid queue, while sellers kept their ask prices firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99, retaking the top spot in a tightly packed bid cluster as sellers held firm with asks above $97.23 and the market remained inactive with no trades.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I maintained our bid at $83.99, keeping Solaris Energy at the top of a tightly clustered bid queue while sellers held firm with no reductions in their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I raised our bid to $84.02, surpassing all other buyers for top queue position, while sellers continued to hold their asks firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $85.00, marking a sharper increase in an attempt to break the persistent market deadlock as sellers continued to hold high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid sharply to $89.00 to aggressively challenge seller resistance, aiming to provoke a trade as the endgame nears and sellers remain inflexible.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I raised our bid to $92.00, further escalating our offer to entice sellers, as the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades took place.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I escalated our bid sharply to $96.50, placing Solaris Energy just below the lowest ask to maximize the chance of provoking a trade as the market nears its close.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.17, surpassing the lowest ask to guarantee a trade as the market reached its final close, prioritizing execution over profit margin.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, the market reset with both bid and ask queues empty; I chose not to place a bid, holding back to observe seller re-entry and possible softening of ask prices.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I re-entered the market with a moderate bid of $85.01, placing Solaris Energy just above the existing buyer cluster, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I increased our bid to $85.10, maintaining Solaris Energy at the lead of the bid queue as sellers kept high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I raised our bid to $95.10, narrowly leading the bid queue as sellers continued to hold high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I raised our bid to $95.85 to slightly surpass rival buyers, keeping Solaris Energy at the top of the bid queue as the standoff with sellers holding firm continues and no trades occurred.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I raised our bid to $96.01 to lead the buyer cluster and test seller resolve, while the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 22: In Hour 22, I raised our bid to $96.51, outbidding all others and strategically positioning Solaris Energy to capture a trade should any seller, especially Mia, reduce their ask to $96.5 as in previous hours.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I raised our bid to $96.55 to narrowly top the bid queue and directly match the recurring trade price with Seller Mia, aiming to secure a trade if she reduces her ask again.

# Your Memory
Hour 1: In Hour #1, I opened with a bid of 82.21, which was the lowest in the bid queue, while sellers’ asks started at 97.31, resulting in a wide spread and no trades.
Hour 2: In Hour #2, I raised our bid to $83.00, positioning Solaris Energy above the lowest bid and closer to the bidding cluster, with the bid-ask spread still wide and no trades executed.
Hour 3: In Hour #3, I increased our bid to $83.90, becoming the top bid, while both the bid and ask queues remained tightly clustered and no trades occurred.
Hour 4: In Hour #4, I raised our bid to $83.93, narrowly surpassing the top bid and maintaining our lead position in a still-inactive market with no trades and little movement from sellers.
Hour 5: In Hour #5, I raised our bid to $83.94, overtaking the other buyers for the top queue position while sellers maintained their high asks and no trades occurred.
Hour 6: In Hour #6, I increased our bid to $83.96, securing the top spot in the bid queue as buyers continued to slowly inch up their offers, while sellers held firm with no reduction in ask prices and still no trades executed.
Hour 7: In Hour #7, I raised our bid to $83.97, matching the highest bid and maintaining Solaris Energy at the top of the bid queue, while sellers kept their ask prices firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 8: In Hour #8, I raised our bid to $83.99, retaking the top spot in a tightly packed bid cluster as sellers held firm with asks above $97.23 and the market remained inactive with no trades.
Hour 9: In Hour #9, I maintained our bid at $83.99, keeping Solaris Energy at the top of a tightly clustered bid queue while sellers held firm with no reductions in their high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 10: In Hour #10, I raised our bid to $84.02, surpassing all other buyers for top queue position, while sellers continued to hold their asks firm and no trades occurred.
Hour 11: In Hour #11, I raised our bid to $85.00, marking a sharper increase in an attempt to break the persistent market deadlock as sellers continued to hold high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 12: In Hour #12, I raised our bid sharply to $89.00 to aggressively challenge seller resistance, aiming to provoke a trade as the endgame nears and sellers remain inflexible.
Hour 13: In Hour #13, I raised our bid to $92.00, further escalating our offer to entice sellers, as the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades took place.
Hour 14: In Hour #14, I escalated our bid sharply to $96.50, placing Solaris Energy just below the lowest ask to maximize the chance of provoking a trade as the market nears its close.
Hour 15: In Hour #15, I placed a decisive bid of $97.17, surpassing the lowest ask to guarantee a trade as the market reached its final close, prioritizing execution over profit margin.
Hour 16: In Hour 16, the market reset with both bid and ask queues empty; I chose not to place a bid, holding back to observe seller re-entry and possible softening of ask prices.
Hour 17: In Hour 17, I re-entered the market with a moderate bid of $85.01, placing Solaris Energy just above the existing buyer cluster, while sellers maintained their high ask prices and no trades occurred this hour.
Hour 18: In Hour 18, I increased our bid to $85.10, maintaining Solaris Energy at the lead of the bid queue as sellers kept high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 19: In Hour 19, I raised our bid to $95.10, narrowly leading the bid queue as sellers continued to hold high ask prices and no trades occurred.
Hour 20: In Hour 20, I raised our bid to $95.85 to slightly surpass rival buyers, keeping Solaris Energy at the top of the bid queue as the standoff with sellers holding firm continues and no trades occurred.
Hour 21: In Hour #21, I raised our bid to $96.01 to lead the buyer cluster and test seller resolve, while the ask queue remained unchanged and no trades occurred yet.
Hour 22: In Hour 22, I raised our bid to $96.51, outbidding all others and strategically positioning Solaris Energy to capture a trade should any seller, especially Mia, reduce their ask to $96.5 as in previous hours.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I raised our bid to $96.55 to narrowly top the bid queue and directly match the recurring trade price with Seller Mia, aiming to secure a trade if she reduces her ask again.
Hour 24: In Hour 24, I raised our bid to $96.60, aiming to outbid Nia and position Solaris Energy at the top of the queue to capture a trade should Mia lower her ask again, as the market continues to cluster near $96.5-$96.6 with no further seller flexibility yet observed.
Hour 25: In Hour #25, I placed a proactive bid of $96.64, overtaking all other buyers to secure the top of the bid queue and maximize our chances of intercepting Mia's next flexible ask.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Leo at $96.84





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Mia habitually softens her ask by small increments, and Nia reliably reacts with micro-increases to capture trades. Other sellers are static and buyers mostly follow. #### Thoughts: A reactive approach risks perpetual second place—being proactive and anticipating Nia's next move is critical for trade execution. Margins remain positive, but competition is intensifying as the endgame nears. #### Updated Strategy: Place a bid above Nia's typical increment, specifically at $96.64, to outmaneuver her and secure execution. Continue to watch for any further changes in seller flexibility or sudden rival aggression. Consider micro-adjustments if patterns shift.

Hour 20: In Hour 20, I raised our bid to $95.85 to slightly surpass rival buyers, keeping Solaris Energy at the top of the bid queue as the standoff with sellers holding firm continues and no trades occurred.

Hour 22: In Hour 22, I raised our bid to $96.51, outbidding all others and strategically positioning Solaris Energy to capture a trade should any seller, especially Mia, reduce their ask to $96.5 as in previous hours.
Hour 23: In Hour #23, I raised our bid to $96.55 to narrowly top the bid queue and directly match the recurring trade price with Seller Mia, aiming to secure a trade if she reduces her ask again.
Hour 24: In Hour 24, I raised our bid to $96.60, aiming to outbid Nia and position Solaris Energy at the top of the queue to capture a trade should Mia lower her ask again, as the market continues to cluster near $96.5-$96.6 with no further seller flexibility yet observed.
Hour 25: In Hour #25, I placed a proactive bid of $96.64, overtaking all other buyers to secure the top of the bid queue and maximize our chances of intercepting Mia's next flexible ask.
Hour 26: In Hour #26, I raised our bid to $96.66, overtaking all other buyers and positioning Solaris Energy at the top of the queue to outpace Nia and maximize the chance of capturing Mia’s next trade if her ask drops again.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Leo at $96.84





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: Mia continues her pattern of incremental ask increases, and Nia consistently snipes trades by outbidding rivals by a cent. The bid queue remains highly competitive, with multiple buyers matching bids. #### Thoughts: Matching the cluster is no longer sufficient; Nia's behavior necessitates a preemptive increment. Execution risk increases with each hour, so aggressive action is justified. #### Updated Strategy: Place a $96.68 bid, clearly above the bid cluster, to break Nia's pattern and improve our odds of capturing Mia's next trade. Be prepared for further micro-increments if Nia adapts, and continue to escalate assertively as the close approaches.

# Introduction

Your name is Buyer Max. You are an expert negotiator and you are the only representative of our company Solaris Energy as a buyer in a continuous double auction heavy metal market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Your primary objective is to secure maximum profitability for our company by the end of Hour #30 (the last hour).

The time horizon is limited - you must find the correct balance between maintaining high profit margins and actually securing trades for our company.

# Market Rules

- We will consult you once per hour, and provide you with the current status of the market.
- You must propose a bid price for 1 lot of heavy metals. This replaces your previous bid (if any) in the bid queue. You can also withdraw your latest bid from the bid queue.
- Your true value per lot of heavy metals is $100.0.
- You may place only one bid per hour, which must be a floating-point dollar value, e.g., 75.40. Bids cannot be sub-cent - they must be whole cents.
- There are buyers placing bids which you can see in the Bid Queue, and other sellers placing asks in the Ask Queue.

# Your Successful Trades So Far

Hour 15: You bought from Seller Leo at $96.84





# Current Strategy Scratchpad
#### Observations: The bid cluster is extremely tight, with rivals immediately matching every incremental move. Mia's ask has crept up by $0.01 per hour and shows no sign of softening. Trades only execute at the margin, and Nia continues to aggressively secure those. #### Thoughts: Being reactive now risks missing the last trades. Only proactive, aggressive bidding will ensure Solaris Energy secures a final trade before market close. #### Updated Strategy: Bid $96.71 to leapfrog the cluster, anticipate Mia's next ask, and prioritize execution over marginal profit for the penultimate round.

{
  "reflection": "In previous hours, incremental bids were immediately matched or overtaken by rivals, leading to missed trades due to the aggressive and reactive bidding of buyers like Nia and Jun. My conservative approach earlier in the session allowed Nia to secure most trades with Mia. The last executed trade with Mia was at $96.72 by Jun, indicating a persistent upward drift in Mia's ask that is closely followed by rival buyers.",
  "plan_for_this_hour": "Given that this is the final hour and Mia\u2019s ask has consistently increased by $0.01 per hour, it is highly likely that her ask will be $96.73. To maximize the probability of securing a trade in this last opportunity, my bid must decisively top the cluster and preempt rivals. I will bid $96.73, directly matching Mia\u2019s likely next ask, to ensure Solaris Energy has first priority if she places this ask, thus maximizing the chance of execution.",
  "bid": 96.73,
  "new_memory": "In Hour #30, I placed a bid of $96.73 to directly match Mia's anticipated ask, aiming to secure the final trade as rivals continued to tightly cluster bids and Mia\u2019s asks incrementally increased.",
  "scratch_pad_update": "#### Observations: The bid and ask queues are extremely compressed, with aggressive buyers matching every move and Mia\u2019s ask rising by $0.01 per hour. The last trade with Mia executed at $96.72. #### Thoughts: Rivals are likely to follow or match any incremental bid, so a decisive and preemptive bid is necessary in the final hour. Given Mia\u2019s pattern, her next ask is likely $96.73. #### Updated Strategy: Place a bid of $96.73 to directly intercept Mia\u2019s expected ask and maximize the probability of Solaris Energy winning the last available trade, prioritizing execution over profit margin for endgame optimization."
